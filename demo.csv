16	Mike Butcher	Europe	"There are lots of different approaches to the amorphous market of ‘e-learning’ but only a handful ever feel much like fun. I think amongst the best of these are sites like MangaHigh which teaches Math, or Moshi Monsters which has subtle learning tasks for kids.
Another which works well is Quipper, which, in a Q&A format, helps people learn things in a sort of game. Today it’s announced that it has raised $3.6m (£2.3m) of Series A funding led by Globis, the Japanese VC. The round has been two other investors: Atomico, the London-based VC firm led by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennström and Benesse, a major Japanese education and publishing company.
The fundraising, which seed funding from Atomico last year, will be used expand with an emphasis on increasing the amount of content on the platform
Founded by Masa Watanabe, a co-founder of Japanese mobile social gaming company DeNA, Quipper’s app asks users to answer a series of questions, and they learn during that process. You can also use it to create your own quiz programmes, making the app appeal to teachers and parents but also to professional training companies.
The London-based company says its 1.7 million users have answered questions on the platform 85m times in 2,000 topics since it launched in October last year. The app exists on the site and on Apple iOS and Android."	2012-05-18	556278	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/157834v2-max-450x450.png?w=300	europe/	Quipper Raises $3.6M For Its Fun Take On E-Learning		https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/quipper-raises-3-6m-for-its-fun-take-on-e-learning/	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
67	Sarah Perez	eCommerce	"The recently launched AngelPad-backed payments startup called Ribbon is today introducing functionality that allows users to buy from merchants and other sellers directly in the Facebook News Feed. In addition, the company is confirming the close of its $1.6 million seed round, led by Tim Draper’s Draper Associates. Participating in the round were Siemer Ventures, Emil Michael (Klout COO), Naguib Sawiris, Winston Ibrahim (Hydros) and MicroVentures.
The company had previously raised $120,000 from AngelPad, Gokul Rajaram, Sierra Ventures, and InterWest Partners. Draper’s Joel Yarmon also now sits on Ribbon’s board.
Ribbon, which launched out of AngelPad’s fall 2012 class of startups (as Kout, Inc.), is focused on making digital payments easier by introducing a one-page checkout system that can be linked to from web, email and social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest or anywhere else. But unlike other social commerce, such as Chirpify, which lets you sell on Instagram and Twitter, or Soldsie, which works via Facebook comments, for example, Ribbon’s system is unique in that it’s being designed from the ground up to work cross-platform. It auto-detects where the user is coming from, then tailors the one-page resulting experience accordingly.
The company charges 5 percent plus 30 cents per transaction, compared to Stripe at 2.9 percent plus 30 cents, or Gumroad at 5 percent plus 25 cents, for example.
With today’s launch of Facebook in-stream payments, Ribbon is making social e-commerce even easier than before. Previously, Ribbon would direct Facebook users who clicked on the provided link to a Facebook app, allowing them to complete the transaction on Facebook itself.
“This is even a step shorter,” says co-founder Hany Rashwan of today’s launch of in-stream payments. “We want to save your credit card as soon as you use it, give you one-click checkout as soon as you buy, and it’s truly in-stream at this point.”
The company will create Ribbon accounts for users and email receipts following the purchase.
The interface to these in-stream payments is coded in Flash, so this exact same functionality only works on the desktop version of Facebook for now. On mobile, users can click the link to be redirected to a mobile web-optimized version of the Ribbon experience. (This is because Facebook doesn’t allow for the kind of functionality that the in-stream payments widget now offers within its mobile application.)
The Ribbon in-stream interface on Facebook is fairly robust, supporting a product photo, title, description, inventory level indicator, price and “buy” button. When users click to purchase, they’re walked through a short screen – without leaving their News Feed – where they enter their payment and billing details. Current Ribbon users can also just log in to move through the process even faster, using their saved info.
Rashwan says the company is targeting everyone from smaller, Etsy-type sellers to the “Hollywood crowd” with its product. Ribbon is touting a couple of early adopter success stories, including Grammy-nominated artist Paul Wall who has been using Ribbon to sell his songs, and a charity concert event that raised $4,000 via Ribbon. However, Rashwan declined to provide user adoption numbers, as the service is still too new.
Do Users Want F-Commerce?
While Ribbon’s new in-stream Facebook payments makes buying on Facebook several steps easier than before, the bigger question is whether or not Facebook users want to participate in e-commerce activities on the social network. Facebook Gifts, the site’s own integrated e-commerce efforts, for example, have been slow to ramp up. Combined with Promoted Posts, the two only accounted for less than $5 million in Q4 2012.
The market for “f-commerce” is very new, and some folks are simply doing it wrong in these early days. Some market predictions peg social commerce (meaning Facebook and others) as growing to $30 billion by 2015. Asked for his thoughts on the forthcoming social commerce wave, Rashwan explains that earlier efforts may not have appealed to users because they too closely tried to replicate the traditional e-commerce model directly. “Bigger brands have had trouble selling on Facebook because shopping in a shopping cart does not make sense inside a tab, inside an app,” he says, “and that’s the experience we’ve had so far.”
But if a user happens to come across a News Feed post from an artist, maker, charity or other type of seller, they may be more likely to buy, he believes. Rashwan also adds that because Facebook is so good with discovery, there might be an option to extend beyond payments in the future, as well.
Meaning? “To generate interest in the item without buying it. You could ‘want’ it instead of buying it, and that saves it with us,” he explains.
In other words, Ribbon could offer its users both the option for a buy button and a want button in the future, generating something of a universal wishlist for its audience. This idea is remarkably similar in spirit to Facebook’s Pinteresque Collections feature, which resumed its second phase of testing in December. But on Facebook, users can currently only “want” items (or Save, Add, Collect or Wishlist, depending on the version of the product they’re seeing). In Ribbon, a user’s wishlist would actually be connected with a user’s saved credit card information, and that could potentially be more powerful.
Going forward, Ribbon plans to target YouTube next, as well as enrich the analytics for sellers on its back-end. The company also recently launched its API and hired Teens in Tech’s Daniel Brusilovsky to help with Ribbon’s Biz Dev efforts."	2013-02-05	751156	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ribbon-logo-500px.jpg?w=400	social/	Ribbon Raises $1.6M From Tim Draper & Others, Launches New Way To Take Payments Directly In The Facebook News Feed		https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/05/payments-startup-ribbon-raises-1-6m-from-tim-draper-others-launches-new-way-to-take-payments-directly-in-the-facebook-news-feed/	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
83	Sarah Perez	Apps	"A new mobile app called Banter wants to build an anonymous social network on mobile by carving out a niche for itself that falls somewhere in between mobile messaging apps, like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, and the more “confessional” apps like Secret and Whisper.
Instead, chats in Banter are designed to flow like real-world conversations do, without the fear that everything discussed will be permanently etched in stone, or associated with a user’s public identity. The public chats only remain live for 24 hours, says the company, then they disappear. And you can participate using just a pseudonym.
The service also has some elements that make it feel like old-school message boards, as chats take place in “rooms” which can be event-focused (e.g. a sports event you’re watching, the Oscars, etc.) location-focused (Austin – for SXSW attendees, a local bar, e.g.), topic-focused (a health issue, support groups, gaming, etc.), or any combination of these. In the rooms, users can share text, photos, URLs, videos, GIF’s emoji’s and more, to discuss the topic in real-time.
The company was founded by long-time serial entrepreneur, Andrew Busey, currently a Partner at Chaotic Moon, a mobile strategy and development firm for consumer brands, that’s worked with companies like Disney, Pizza Hut, Pinkberry, Marvel, Xbox, National Geographic, Taco Bell, Starbucks, Samsung, and many, many more.

Busey’s past experience also includes running product management for one the first web browsers, Mosaic, creating one of the first web-based chat solutions with iChat, and later founding and selling Challenge Games to Zynga.
He explains that he was motivated to build Banter because he felt that many of today’s mobile chat clients don’t encourage users to have “real” conversations.
Either you’re engaged in private communications, similar to SMS, with people you know, spilling secrets on confessional apps, or broadcasting messages via your more public persona on Twitter, where followers may be turned off when you suddenly veer into topics you don’t typically discuss. (Like say, when a tech reporter starts live-tweeting a football game. You know who you are.)
“One of my fundamental beliefs is that people have lots of interests, and not all those interests align with their real-life friends, or their existing online friends,” explains Busey.
“For example, I like to game…and my friends, outside of the gaming companies I’ve worked with, are not big gamers.” He says he wanted to maintain relationships with some of his fellow gamers, but doesn’t necessarily view them as friends who he would connect with on Facebook, in all cases. But Banter would allow for that.
With the app that’s launching now for iOS and Android, users will be able to browse and join rooms, as well as initiate more messaging-like private chats with other users. (These stick around longer – for 6 months). However, in the future, the service will support letting users pay a nominal fee (99 cents, likely) for things like establishing multiple profiles, or creating and administering their own private rooms, where they can control membership.
Given that chatters are anonymous, there’s the question of how Banter will deal with trolling behavior or spam. Busey says members can “block” others for now with just a click, but that’s it. While the company has other technology it could roll out if need be, their preference is to rely on user policing of bad behavior if they can, he adds.
Banter also competes with places where people have pseudo-anonymous conversations today on the web, like Reddit. But Busey says he thinks Banter could appeal to Reddit users who may view the app as an extension to, not a replacement of, a larger social network.
The Austin-based startup is a team of five full-time, but had development assistance and investment from some at Chaotic Moon. To date, the company has raised just over $800,000 from founders and other Austin-area angels.
The app is live on both iOS and Android, and is read-only on the web."	2014-03-06	968073	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/banter-twophones.png?w=400	social/	Banter Debuts An Anonymous Social Network On Mobile That Focuses On Interests, Not Confessions		https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/06/banter-debuts-an-anonymous-social-network-on-mobile-that-focuses-on-interests-not-confessions/	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
88	Steve O'Hear	Europe	"Spotify community and playlist sharing site Playlists.net (formerly ShareMyPlaylists) is continuing its drive to put music discovery at the heart of its proposition.
Following a redesigned Spotify app, today the UK startup unveiled an entirely revamped version of its iOS offering in a bid to make it the go-to app for discovering Spotify-powered playlists on Apple’s mobile devices.
New features include the ability to upload playlists, including adding custom artwork, from within iOS — a much requested option, we’re told. But most interesting is a new feature that enables users to “pin” playlists to a location or venue and, in turn, discover music based on their current whereabouts.
So, for example, says the company, you could add your favourite workout playlist to your local gym for other Spotify users to work up a sweat to. Or coffee shop staff could pin a playlist of the music they play in-store for their best hipster customers to enjoy.
In fact, when Playlists.net founder and CEO Kieron Donoghue first pitched me the new location feature, I lazily described it as Foursquare for playlists, not knowing that it is actually powered by Foursquare’s API. “Yes the playlist pinning is just like Foursquare,” he told me in an email. “So when you’re using the app you select a playlist then select “Pin” which then brings up a list of nearby locations (we use the Foursquare API for this) and you can choose to allocate a playlist to that location.”
Donoghue then went on to share a recent article in the WSJ where Spotify co-founder Daniel Ek is cited as describing a vision for location-based music discovery:
That’s strikingly similar to where Playlists.net appears to be heading with today’s iOS update. “So our playlist “Pins” are the first step towards this kind of future,” adds Donoghue. That, of course, begs the question: When will Spotify’s own mobile app introduce a similar feature, especially since the music streaming service has been actively upping its own mobile music discovery game.
Along with playlist upload capabilities and the new location feature, Playlists.net’s iOS app, which requires a Spotify premium subscription, also supports the following features: A library of 145,000 human curated playlists that can be filtered by “Featured”, “Most Played” and “Latest”; playlists based on “Mood”; Top 100 Playlists Charts updated each Monday; New Release Albums updated weekly with the latest new releases; and Playlist Reviews written by Playlist.net’s editorial staff.

155	Rip Empson	Mobile	"Back in early 2011, Ben Schaechter, Sam Grossberg and Paul Kompfner launched GoPollGo to address a perceived deficiency in analytics, geographical info and social integrations from the Web’s go-to polling platforms. Six-months later, with a round of seed funding in tow, the startup decided to re-focus on Twitter — on providing everyday users with the ability to more easily poll their users and drill down into realtime analytics, not unlike WayIn.
Today, GoPollGo offers open graph integration, allows users to embed multimedia within their polls, embed polls on any website and recently launched an app for iOS to offer a more synchronized user experience across platforms. Since launching, the startup has begun working with big media properties like ABC and Yahoo to allow them to offer realtime polling and audience analysis, powering ABC news’ realtime Q&A polling for the Presidential debates, for example.
While these partnerships have provided some monetization opportunities for GoPollGo, it has still been unclear how the team was going to construct a viable, sustainable business. But, today, we got a peek into the future of GoPollGo-as-a-business, with the launch of GoPollGo Promoted Polls. Essentially, the startup’s Promoted Polls now allow anyone to leverage the startup’s audience to get responses to their questions quickly.
“Think of it as simple, speedy market research,” says founder Ben Schaecther (who, for sake of full disclosure, is a former TechCrunch developer). 
Now, when someone creates a poll, they’ll have the ability to promote that poll to get responses for a fee of $0.50-per-response. Similar to what Twitter now does with Promoted Tweets, this means that GoPollGo will intersperse promoted polls within the stream of questions that users cycle through and interact with on a daily basis. [Except, of course, Twitter pushes Promoted Tweets into specific users’ streams, while on GoPollGo, people are just responding randomly to polls, so the startup will surface its own Promoted Polls more randomly as well, though they’ll have a set duration.]
To incentivize businesses, media and individual power users — and make sure they get their money’s worth — GoPollGo guarantees that data for Promoted Polls will be gathered within 48 hours, or the startup will refund the promoter. (The aforementioned “set duration.) The founder says that, although this system is new, the team has already seen thousands of requests for this functionality on its sign-up form. 
Today, Promoted Polls opens in a kind of private beta format so that the team can ensure that it’s able to scale the back-end support efficiently without affecting the overall GoPollGo user experience. The tool is currently limited to one-questions polls and focuses mainly on mobile, but the team plans to offer more robust capabilities (and open the whole shabang publicly in self-serve mode) in the near future — along with potentially offering rev-share opportunities for survey takers themselves. 
Going forward, as the GPG community continues to increase, Schaechter says that the team will begin rolling out new filters (like gender, age and location, for example) that will be offered for a higher price. 
In the big picture, the team is eager to transform from just-another-social-polling tool (albeit an addictive one) to a sustainable business with consumer and business-facing services that provide more monetization opportunities. To add more value and a little more diversification, the founder think that GoPollGo’s software can be easily adapted to surveys. 
SurveyMonkey’s colossal raise (and valuation) last week proves unequivocally the (surprising) size of the opportunity in offering an easy-to-use, cloud-based survey tool. SurveyMonkey has been able to monetize by offering pay-per-response surveys, and it wouldn’t be a stretch for GoPollGo to begin offering a similar service.
While Google offers a basic poll and survey service (what don’t they offer, seriously,) it comes at a $0.10 price point and most other similar tools fall on the more expensive end of the spectrum. Plus, GoPollGo’s community has begun to offer more incentives to those interested in the quick-turnaround option of Promoted Polls, as it’s now seeing 25 percent of its iOS users return daily, pulling in users’ social graphs so that whenever someone they follow creates a poll, etc., they get a push notification.
In turn, its registered user base has increased 20 percent in the last 2.5 weeks, while the app has accumulated “thousands of downloads” and power users are taking as many as 50 to 60 polls per session, Schaechter says. 
The nice thing about GoPollGo and one of the reasons it’s been able to sustain traffic (and that widgets typically receive about 1 million to 2.5 million page views per month) is that users don’t have to login to vote, they can do so straight from the widget or embed — wherever the poll happens to live. None of the users who voted during its ABC integration, for example, were required to login with GoPollGo to interact with the poll. And that’s key.
Things could get thornier the more robust Promoted Polls functionality becomes, but it’s a step in the right direction.

228	Anthony Ha	Apps	"Social discovery service MeetMe is ramping up the advertising in its smartphone app.
CEO Geoff Cook told me via email that the app was already running ads, for example at the top of the screen, but its mobile monetization efforts have been more focused on payments. The new ads, which are being introduced through a partnership with Flurry, will appear in the Live Stream, offering a more “native” approach, Cook said: “This is the first time we are placing ads within the context of the application itself, where the user encounters advertising while scrolling. The ads look and feel more like content with social cues like ratings and comments surfaced.”
A lot of companies are talking about native ads nowadays, and the format can be particularly important in a mobile context, where there’s not a lot of screen space for extra banners. For example, the screenshot below will probably remind you of the ads in Facebook’s mobile news feed. (I’ve also written about a startup called Namo Media, which is all about introducing native ads into news feeds.)

When I asked how MeetMe’s approach differs from Facebook’s, Cook said:

246	Romain Dillet	Artificial Intelligence	"French startup Snips is launching its first product today, an iOS app that is supposed to make your life easier by letting you view and search your data more easily. Snips is a personal assistant that helps you know where you need to be and when.
When you first launch the app, Snips wants you to grant access to your location, calendars, contacts, motion sensor and Gmail account. Then you’re good to go.
The main screen shows a tiny map at the top, a search bar in the middle and a list of events at the bottom. When you open the map, you can add layers of information. For instance, you can see your event locations, your favorite places, your friends’ places, etc. I love maps, so I can see myself using this feature every now and then.
The timeline at the bottom shows my next calendar events. If I tap on an event, I can see more information as well as the location of the event. Unfortunately, you can’t edit the calendar event directly from this timeline view, which can be frustrating when you forgot to add the location of your next meeting.
When you tap on the location of your next event, you can start directions in Google Maps or open another app with this address using deep linking. Snips currently supports Citymapper, Uber, Waze and a few others. Oddly, Snips shows all the available apps by default even though I haven’t installed eCab or Vianavigo. You can hide them in the settings, but this feature could have been more elegant.
My (now defunct) favorite calendar app Sunrise was smart and only showed the apps you already have on your phone. Similarly, Citymapper is more powerful than Snips as it gives you an ETA as well as a price estimation so that you know if it makes more sense to order an Uber or take the subway. I don’t see myself using Snips to move around Paris as I can open Citymapper from Fantastical in just one tap and get better ETAs. Snips would be an extra step.
And finally, you can search for restaurants, coffee shops or bars around this location with a few shortcuts at the bottom. Snips seems to be using the Foursquare API and displays results directly in the app. Once again, the results don’t have a lot of information. You’ll have to open the Foursquare app using deep linking to see tips or the menu.
In my timeline, I can also see my Eventbrite ticket for an event I’m attending tonight. Snips retrieved this information from my Gmail account. Over time, Snips is supposed to learn when I’m going to work and coming home and suggest these events in my timeline.
Then, there’s the search bar. The search feature combines everything I’ve mentioned in a different way. You can search for calendar events, places, tickets or contact information. It’s useful, but you’d expect more from a startup that promises to reinvent AI-powered assistants. I’ve been using the built-in Spotlight feature in iOS to get the same information, and it’s not where iOS shines.
And there’s a reason why Snips seems quite limited right now. Compared to other assistants, such as Google Now, Microsoft’s Cortana, Facebook’s M and Amazon’s Alexa, Snips takes privacy very seriously and doesn’t store your data on its servers. Everything happens on your phone, and you stay in control of your data.
I’m in favor of taking privacy seriously. But this stance is also limiting. Siri and Snips share the same shortcomings — users expect to be able to do complicated search queries that combine multiple web services.
Snips doesn’t allow me to do that. It’s just a central hub for all my calendar, contact and location data. But iOS has already been a good central hub for this data.
So Snips is in a corner right now as I don’t see how it could become as powerful as Google Now or Alexa. It has already taken them years to come up with this app. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple are not going to slow down. The French startup first needs to implement natural language queries.
Snips is tackling one of the toughest challenges in tech right now. Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are all working hard on improving their personal assistants. That’s why it’s good to see small companies innovating in this space, such as Viv, Hound and Snips. So let’s see if Snips can crack the code and put all the pieces of this complicated puzzle together."	2016-05-17	1323081	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/robottoy.jpg?w=738	mobile/	Snips is a personal assistant that combines all your data in one app		https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/snips-is-a-personal-assistant-that-combines-all-your-data-in-one-app/	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
279	Romain Dillet	Europe	"French startup Infinit just released its mobile app for both iOS and Android. In addition to providing a simple way to send files to your friends and colleagues, it is now a full-fledged AirDrop replacement as well. As a reminder, Infinit is a file-sharing service that differs from WeTransfer or CloudApp as it uses peer-to-peer technology to boost file sharing between two users. And there isn’t any file size restriction.
Until now, many video game developers or post production specialists were using Infinit to send big files to their colleagues. For instance, Infinit can handle a huge uncompressed 100GB video file without breaking a sweat. You don’t need to leave your computer open as Infinit can pause and resume your uploads.
Behind the scene, when two persons are in the same office, Infinit uses the local network to send those files as quickly as possible. But if you are at home, Infinit seamlessly switches to a secure peer-to-peer connection. Finally, if your recipient is offline, Infinit also starts uploading right away by sending the file to its servers.
At first, the company didn’t see how a mobile app would be useful for these particular use cases. But chances are that your phone is now your primary camera. You might want to send a few HD videos from your last vacation. Right now, it is very complicated to send those files to your friends, or even to your computer. Infinit makes this a little easier.
When you open the app, you are presented with a big paper plane button at the bottom. If you press it, you can select a few photos and videos, and then send them. If your friend uses Infinit, they will receive a push notification to accept the transfer. Otherwise, they will get a link to download the files from Infinit’s servers.
The app doesn’t create a web gallery to showcase your photos, it sends your photos without compressing them or altering them in any way — this is where Infinit stands out from messaging apps that all compress your photos and videos. On mobile, the company uses the exact same technology as on desktop, meaning that you can send your files and forget about them. It takes advantage of your local Wi-Fi, creates a peer-to-peer connection if you are not on the same network or uploads to Infinit’s servers.
Finally, Infinit is a great way to share files between your own devices. Maybe you are using a Windows PC, an Android phone and an iPad — Infinit now runs on all these platforms. And I find the user experience much more effective than using AirDrop, uploading a file to Dropbox or sending an email to myself.
Infinit raised $1.8 million from Alven Capital and 360 Capital Partners and is a Techstars NY alumnus. The company plans to roll out a premium offering soon."	2015-03-31	1138431	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mail.jpg?w=738	startups/	Infinit’s New Mobile Apps Might Be The Best Way To Transfer Those Pesky HD Videos		https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/infinits-new-mobile-apps-might-be-the-best-way-to-transfer-those-pesky-hd-videos/	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
342	Billy Gallagher	Startups	"Snapchat, the impermanent messaging app that won “Fastest Rising Startup” at the 2012 Crunchies, has finalized a $13.5 million Series A round led by Benchmark’s Mitch Lasky.
According to The New York Times, Snapchat is now valued between $60 and $70 million. In December, GigaOm’s Om Malik reported that Snapchat was raising an $8 million round from Benchmark at roughly a $50 million valuation; and our own Eric Eldon wrote that Snapchat was raising a Series A “north of $10 million” at a rough $70 million valuation, led by Lasky.
Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel confirmed the funding to me, and noted that the company now sees 60 million snaps sent per day, and users have sent over 5 billion snaps in total. The company has hired five new employees, bringing the total staff to 10, and has moved to a new office in Venice Beach, CA.
Spiegel tells me the company will use the funding for “hiring and servers, definitely. But most importantly, it allows us to remain independent and continue to grow the Snapchat community.”
The Times also reported that Mark Zuckerberg met with the Snapchat team in December, shortly before Facebook launched carbon copy competitor Poke.
Snapchat previously raised $485,000 from Lightspeed Venture Partners.
“I started hearing Snapchat in the same context as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook,” Lasky said to The Times, echoing Barry Eggers’ sentiments when he was involved in Lightspeed’s investment. “That got me curious.”
Update: Lasky has posted about Snapchat on his personal blog, explaining that he will be joining the company’s board of directors along with Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy.
Lasky also noted that he spent most of his career in LA, where Snapchat’s offices are.

390	Sarah Perez	Apps	"Social discovery service (and TechCrunch Disrupt alumni) Sonar has some big news today, and just in time for SXSW: it’s arriving on Android. According to founder Brett Martin, support for the Android platform has long been users’ most frequent request for the service.
But that’s not the only thing that’s new. Along with the Android launch, the company is also making a slight, but important shift, in terms of how it will show its users recommended people nearby.
Starting with the Android launch, instead of focusing on people checked in to particular venues, Sonar is now expanding to show you just those people close to your current location and then ranking them by relevancy. Before, Sonar showed its results first as a list of places, which you would then tap into to see its people recommendations. Going forward, the app is defaulting to a people list which starts with your friends, then shows you other relevant folks nearby. (However, you can still switch over to the Places list if you prefer).
Although there are a lot of apps now competing in the newly hot “social discovery” space, Sonar’s position in this battle has been to focus on its ranking technology as its defining factor.
“We spent the past several months really investing in our technology platform, and with this new app you’re going to start to see the fruits of that labor,” explains Martin. “The most obvious part of it is that Sonar before was very venue-focused…but now we’re doing this thing called ‘people nearby.'”
Basically, he says, the app looks at every person near you who has tweeted or who has checked in on Facebook or Foursquare, and it appends as much information as possible to them, including their Facebook and LinkedIn profile information, for example.
The company has also been working to integrate other sources of data into its platform, including things like Facebook and LinkedIn Events, as well as RSVP’s from invite services like Eventbrite. Obviously, these sorts of features would come in handy for an event like SXSW, which involves parties, activities and events which are often so crowded it’s hard to find who you may know (or want to know) in the room.
In preparation for SXSW, Sonar is partnering with several events and is analyzing their RSVP lists to make recommendations which will be sent out prior to the event itself to Sonar users.
Martin admits that Sonar is in a very crowded space, but he believes that they have the best ranking technology when it comes to its people recommendations. As to what makes it the best? Says Martin, “it’s our ability to synthesize profiles across networks in real time, and really dig in and give you the richest information about people nearby.”
Plus, he adds, “having LinkedIn alone at a work conference like SXSW is obviously something people are really going to want.”
These features, as well as the Android version, are starting to arrive today (the iPhone updates are arriving over the course of the week). The Android version launches first, but will be in beta. To download the Android app, you’ll need to use the code TECHCRUNCH for an invite by clicking here: bit.ly/sonarandroidbeta. There are just 250 invites available, unfortunately, so hurry.
As for what’s in the works for Sonar in the future, it sounds like there may be an API in the works. When describing the platform’s new Everbrite integration for RSVP list parsing, Martin says, “you can see how Sonar can apply its people recommendations not just in our app, but outside of our in other people’s applications and applications across the web.”
Oh, so a Sonar API?, we asked.
“I didn’t say that. But that’s good intuition on your part,” Martin responded.
Sounds intriguing."	2012-03-05	512903	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/droid-people.png?w=400	social/	Just In Time For SXSW, Social Discovery Service Sonar Arrives On Android		https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/05/just-in-time-for-sxsw-social-discovery-service-sonar-arrives-on-android/	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
495	Josh Constine	Opinion	"Each sharing medium has its virtuosos. YouTube celebrities, Instagram artists, Vine comedians. And soon, thanks to the private ephemeral messaging app’s new public broadcast feature Stories, we may see Snapchat superstars take the spotlight. Their creations could make Snapchat less about intimate conversations and more of place where the whole world gathers in one person’s shoes for a few seconds.
Stories is a radical shift for Snapchat. For a demo, you can check out mine under my silly handle “Steenboat”. Until now, the app been the quintessential lean mobile product that nails one use case. You take a photo or video, jazz it up with some drawings or text, and send it to one or a bunch of friends with a self-destruct timer that deletes your messages within 10 seconds of it being seen. It felt personal and urgent. You were one of the lucky people selected to gaze through this fleeting window into a friend’s life.
But the startup noticed an odd emergent behavior. What was intended for back-and-forth conversations between two people or to let you share something exclusive with a small group was being used less discretely. Snapchatters were sending their little moments to dozens and dozens of friends — almost like they would broadcast a Facebook post to a large, though still private, group.
Some people were even trying to build a fan base for their Snaps. “The Snapchat Artist” pushes the limits of the app’s rudimentary drawing feature to recreate classic paintings and compose portraits they screenpic and post on their blog. BuzzFeed highlighted the work of James McKenna, who doodles on photos to create surreal visions of his New York Subway commute that he’d share on Reddit.

Meanwhile, Snapchat was looking to become more robust and potentially set up a new way to interact that would increase the time people spent in the app, and create an opportunity for making money. Despite seeing people send 350 million photos and videos a day (stunningly, that’s about as many as Facebook), and raising $73 million in venture capital, it wasn’t making money.
So it launched Stories. Instead of, or along with, having your Snap delivered with a push notification to specific friends, you can post it to your Story. Your friends can tap your Story to see all the photos and videos you’ve added to it over the last 24 hours. But buried in the settings, a new option was added. One that could turn Snapchat into a vector for self-expression to a mass audience.
All an aspiring Snapchat star has to do is promote their username and they can build a following for their constantly evolving story. Witty jokesters, steady painters, beautiful models, artsy photographers, and inspiring videographers are just a few types of Snapchat celebrities that could be catapulted to fame by Stories.
I asked McKenna, the closest thing Snapchat has to a star so far, whether he’ll be using Stories. He gave me an emphatic ‘yes’, noting “with Stories there’s a really good platform to have an overarching theme that I think would end up being hysterical. So far it’s just been quick snaps of people with some horrible drawing.” You can follow McKenna on Snapchat at “chillhartman”. As Snapchat-specific artists learn the strengths of the Stories medium, we can expect some full-fledged tales of adventure and daily life to emerge.

Then there’s the potential for existing celebrities to amplify their stardom through Snapchat Stories. The medium could let a celebrity like Katy Perry or Jimmy Kimmel delight fans and make them more loyal by offering quick peeks into their daily lives. And since content disappears from Stories 24 hours after it’s posted, there’s less need to worry if their make-up or acting is perfect.
Stories could also be a perfect vector for advertising on Snapchat. Right now when you swipe to your friends list, you see a “Recent Updates” section that lists friends who’ve added Snaps to their Stories. “Promoted Stories” from brands or public figures could fit naturally there. You could see the tale of a hungry man’s quest for Taco Bell, or clips from recent concerts by a musician performing soon in your city.
If the Stories feature goes as planned, it could make Snapchat something you browse when you’re bored, not just an app you open when you receive a message. That could give it the eyeballs necessary to start making money. The only risk is that by giving users a more public way to share their perspective, it could lose the simple focus and intimacy that made us so excited to get notifications from that little smiling ghost."	2013-10-09	889633	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/995912_229907200489690_621056770_n-1.jpg?w=400	social/	Who Will Be The First Snapchat Stories Celebrity?		https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/09/snapchat-celebrities/	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
556	Jordan Crook	Mobile	"How timely. After launching a year ago at Disrupt NYC 2011, Tracks is today releasing one of its biggest updates to date. The service is much like Color, but without the creepy factor as any and all members of a specific photo-sharing group must be invited. I like to think of it as the place where Color and Google+ Circles intersect, but I far prefer Tracks than either of the former.
Thus far Tracks has offered iOS, web- and real-world versions of your tracks (the collection of photos shared with a specific social network, which can be both geo-temporal or last forever). Today, however, the service gets much more beefy, with the ability to shoot and send real-time video and the addition of new filters, Instagram-style. There are now ten filter options on the app, and they’ll all work on both photos and videos.
But that’s not all. The update brings with it the ability to add friends to various tracks from Facebook and Twitter, as well as a new custom camera with multi-shot capability and locks for exposure and focus. Animations have also been added.
Tracks has seen great success since its debut at Disrupt last year, launching an iPhone app officially in October and raising a $1 million round in December. The company also enticed Photobucket’s founder Alex Welch to join the board.
Speaking of Mr. Welch, here’s what he had to say about today’s Tracks update:
The idea of a private social network is one of the few new social ideas that I can jump on board with, and it’ll be interesting to see how the company builds out this offering with behemoths like Facebook and Twitter still growing at a solid pace.

690	Fitz Tepper	Apps	"If you’ve ever tried to learn a foreign language, you probably know that most existing methods focus on aspects of the language that aren’t very helpful in everyday life. For example, newcomers to a language are often first taught the names of animals or colors, words that aren’t normally applicable to the common traveler.
Smigin aims to fix this problem with its app that allows travelers to build and hear common phrases spoken by a native speaker. The app’s Phrasebuilder consists of a three-column interface where users can combine actions and nouns, letting them create tens of thousands of different sentences on the fly.
Smigin today released a total overhaul which for the first time introduces a monetization strategy for the year-old company. The app now categorizes phrasebooks within each language by popular sections like cafes, bars, and shopping.

The cafe section will be free in all languages, and users can pay $4.99 to unlock all additional categories for a specific language. Susan O’Brien, Smigin’s CEO told me that the company chose to leave the cafe section free because it’s by far the most used category, and is broad enough that it can still sometimes apply to other situations.
One thing unique about Smigin is that users can only create phrases incorporating the infinitive form of verbs. This restriction allows the app to produce translations that always sound like something out of native speaker’s mouth.
For example, you can use the app to say “I have to eat” or “I need to eat”, but not phrases like “she is eating right now”. As seen in the photo below (with the example “to eat”), most Romanic languages can have 50 or more different ways to conjugate one verb. Even most advanced translation algorithms have yet to crack the complicated world of conjugations, which is why Smigin decided to forgo them all together.

While the lack of verb conjugation is potentially limiting, the goal is that the app’s more than 10,000 phrases per language should be enough to support you when traveling abroad, while not sounding like a total tourist.
The app currently supports translation in Italian, Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French. The company said more languages are in the works including Swedish, Filipino, German, and Haitian Creole.
Smigin now has almost 90,000 downloads across 175 countries, and has raised about $200,000 in seed funding.
The new update is available now on the iOS App Store, and the app will be coming to Android soon."	2015-07-02	1178495	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/unnamed.png?w=738	startups/	Smigin Is a Foreign Language Tool That Doesn’t Make You Sound Like A Tourist		https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/02/smigin-is-a-foreign-language-tool-that-doesnt-make-you-sound-like-a-tourist/	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
814	Edith Yeung	Apps	"

In February 2011, I visited my friend Bill Huang who worked for Tencent in Shenzhen. Bill was telling me about their new messaging app, called WeChat, that had just launched. At the time, I had been using WhatsApp for more than a year. I asked Bill why they would build a copycat. His reply? He simply insisted that I download the app and take it for a spin.
That night, I went home to Hong Kong and installed it on my mom’s iPad. To my surprise, she got it right away — she still couldn’t figure out how to turn off her iPad, but she could send me a smiley face. I knew WeChat was onto something big.
Since then, WeChat has grown dramatically. The app has not only changed how my mother communicates, but has ingrained itself into the lives of the 570 million people who logged in on a daily basis in September 2015. To showcase WeChat’s ubiquity: Penetration rates in all tier-one Chinese cities (10+ million population) are above 90 percent of the population.
WeChat has a depth of engagement that most other apps cannot match because of the breadth of social features it offers — from Moments, for sharing news and links, high-quality video and audio chat (users generate 540 years of video/voice every day), to stickers and gaming (15 percent of users play 10 minutes of games per day). These features don’t simply promote transactional messages, but rather forms of self-expression.
This engagement allows WeChat to experiment and become a platform for all sorts of new messaging or payment-based features. Many people outside of China fail to realize the breadth of use cases and verticals that WeChat now spans, from e-commerce, to transportation, to financial services.
WeChat’s amazing social (and now payments, too) experience has morphed it into a global platform, with people using it to find jobs in South Africa, to raise money for their nonprofit in California, to sell real estate in Manhattan and to find a date in South Asia.
To show the many touch points WeChat now owns across a user’s daily life, here are some of the successful-but-under-the-radar use cases that go beyond in-app games and social posts.
WeChat launched its money payments service in 2013, smartly modeling it off the thousand-year-old Chinese tradition of gifting money in red envelopes. Between 2014 and 2015, WeChat users sent more than 1 billion “red envelopes” to one another on the app — 50 times more than the year before. 50 million users are now sending red envelopes every day, and that number will likely double again by early next year. The trump card for WeChat payments is that you don’t need to add a contact to pay them — you use a simple QR code.
 

Users can book taxis directly in WeChat through rideshare services like Didi Kuaidi in China or EasyTaxi in Singapore. Users can see the driver’s details and location, as well as communicate with the driver within WeChat. At the end of the trip, users can easily pay for the ride through a WeChat payment.

 
Chinese residents can now use WeChat for a multitude of bill and payment options that go beyond what we see in the West — or any “messaging” app, for that matter. In some cities, people can now pay for their water, electricity, gas, broadband, mobile, tax and credit card bills through a service account on WeChat.
As of August 2014, there are more than 5 million public and service accounts on WeChat. Users also can go into a store, scan a product’s barcode within WeChat and get a list of the Chinese e-commerce sites that stock the product in question. With just a few clicks, you could be saving money by buying the item online. Users also can buy train and movie tickets through WeChat, or top off their phone credits instead of going to the market to buy a card.

Users and brands can easily set up their own shops and start selling on WeChat using Weidian (English name: YouShop). Weidian’s mobile commerce platform is based on WeChat’s social relationships and opens up peer-to-peer selling on a massive scale, as well as a portal for bigger brands.
JD.com was one of the first retail giants to set up a shopping channel on WeChat, and now nearly 70 percent of JD.com users look for recommended products through WeChat. Brands will leverage public accounts and pages to recommend products through WeChat and inform them about promotional activities. This is how Tencent is competing with Alibaba.
Brands are also using WeChat a lot like how Twitter is used in the West: to engage customers in conversation before, during and after a sale. Retail workers are communicating with customers through their WeChat accounts as one of the best channels to establish a rapport and make sure the customer is satisfied.
One feature that was just launched in the most recent WeChat update is multi-party video chat. WeChat’s codecs and China’s networks are now good enough to host impressive-quality mobile video; frankly, it’s a much better experience than Skype. Watch for video to continue to be a big source of growth for the messaging app.
WeChat is involved in starting a private bank called WeBank, which Tencent invested in and is the biggest shareholder (30 percent). WeBank promises to introduce a camera-based facial recognition system for the approval of bank loans, and offer the option of linking your WeChat account to a standard bank card.

With so many daily active users, WeChat is also a firehose for nonprofit donations. The donation function supports organizations like UNICEF and San Francisco-based Watsi. Prior to partnering with WeChat/Tencent, Watsi had 14,000 total individual donors. In two months, WeChat added 34,000 Chinese donors to that tally, helping fund healthcare for people around the world. Most are micro-donations, at around $.25 on average, but those numbers add up quickly.
And then there are some really out-of-the-box uses cases…
WeChat for Small Jobs: Earlier this year, WeChat invested in M4JAM (Money For Jam), a South Africa-based mobile job service that connects to WeChat. M4JAM uses WeChat to push “small jobs” out to their community of users, who respond via their phone to apply/accept jobs.
WeChat for Real Estate: Last year a New York-based real estate agent received a message on WeChat from a Chinese buyer who wanted information about a residential building in Manhattan. The agent sent the Chinese buyer some pictures and some details about the neighborhood. The next day, after speaking on the phone, the agent closed the $13 million deal.
WeChat for Dating: WeChat’s “Look Around” feature allows users to scan and link up with users within a 3 kilometer radius. The feature is now being used in some countries to help people find dates.
All of this is to show that WeChat, like Facebook before it, is becoming a hub for much more than just socializing — and is quickly building a network of potentially massive businesses. Tencent is successfully unlocking a new mobile economy that touches users’ needs from the moment they wake up and check their social feed, to when they pay for their lunch, to when they go out on a date and buy a movie ticket in the evening.
This is the World of WeChat. And it’s just getting started."	2015-11-26	1240454	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/message-in-a-bottle.jpg?w=738	mobile/	The Many Ways Of WeChat: How Messaging Is Eating The World		https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/26/the-many-ways-of-wechat-how-messaging-is-eating-the-world/	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
893	Jordan Crook	Apps	"Snapchat has been on a roll lately, scooping up a $13.5 million funding round from Benchmark last week, toying around with monetization features, and becoming the world’s favorite misunderstood mobile app.
But today the train keeps on chugging, as Snapchat has released a beta build of its Android app that includes the ability to send self-destructing video messages along with the usual picture messages. But be forewarned, loyal Snapchatters, as the beta link expires at 2am PST. 
To be perfectly clear, this is a pre-release beta build. Snapchat is still working out a few kinks before launching the official Android update, but a few lucky users will have the chance to hop on the beta tonight. 
Snapchat launched its new video feature for iOS in December of last year.
Just in case you decided to take a year off from tech news consumption, Snapchat is one of the fastest rising startups of 2012. It lets users send self-destructing selfies (photos of oneself), complete with the ability to add doodles and text.
The idea is that Snapchat users, many of whom have grown up using social networks since they were ‘tweens, are yearning for a place where they can stop worrying about keeping up virtual appearances. Since Snapchat photos self-destruct, users are able share a real moment, even if they’re Snapping with someone thousands of miles away.
“Video is really important to our service because it allows Snapchatters to share a broad range of experiences and emotions,” said Evan Spiegel. “The Snapchat community is all about living in the moment and video brings those moments to life.”  
Many members of the media concluded that such a service was only useful for sexting, but Snapchat’s growth to now sending over 60 million snaps per day puts those rumors to rest. In total, users have now sent over 5 billion snaps in a little over a year."	2013-02-11	755684	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/snapchat_beta_icon.png?w=300	startups/	Snapchat Brings Video To Android In A Private Beta		https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/snapchat-brings-video-to-android-in-a-private-beta/	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
934		Europe	"Pedius is a four-month-old Italian startup that has an app currently available for Android that enables the deaf to make phone calls. The user texts a message, and that text translates to speech at the other side of the phone call. There is also a clean-looking website to accompany it, and, although it is currently available only in Italian, it is soon set to expand to Brazil, the United States, and India.
The founder, Lorenzo Di Ciaccio, described the service as being “about [fulfilling] a big human need: independence. In some countries, the deaf can make phone calls using special call centers known as relay services, where an operator calls on behalf of the deaf. This implies an issue of privacy and [then there is the] delay in waiting for a free operator.” And though the Ente Nazionale Sordi – that is, The National Body of the Deaf – have apps available for a smartphone that allow the deaf to call a taxi or call the police, Pedius is bound strictly by who one can text.
In other countries, a relay service means that a third party listens to a call being made by someone else and types it out for the person who is deaf or hearing impaired. This is the case in Australia, who have what they call the “National Relay Service.” Though Australia’s Privacy Act of 1988 and its subsequent modifications aim to protect the privacy of those using the relay service, there is still an active third party involved with these phone calls, and it’s something that the National Relay Service’s own explanatory video seeks to address.
4,000 calls have been made from Pedius so far. There are 800 users and 200 use the system daily. It works in Italian, English and Spanish, and French will be available next month.
In many countries, Lorenzo said, these services aren’t available 24 hours per day. During the private beta test, users “called restaurants for reservations, doctors to schedule a visit, and many other services.” Sometimes those answering at restaurants would hang up, thinking that they were getting some sort of an automated sales call – a ‘Congratulations, you may already be a winner!’ – but if that happened, Lorenzo said, “we called restaurants explaining what Pedius is and would clarify that by hanging up, they probably lost a customer. This – most of the time – is enough.”
They’re also trying to figure out how to deal with companies that use phone calls as part of a ‘user validation’ process. Does Pedius count as a text, an e-mail, or a phone call? How will it be evaluated by systems like this?
“Of course,” Lorenzo said. “Not all of the problems are so tough. Some of our users are asking to have a male voice instead of a female voice.” Some ask if “they can use Pedius on a PC with a bigger keyboard.”"	2014-03-26	978856	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-26-at-10-44-24-am.png?w=400	europe/	Pedius Lets Italy’s Deaf Make Phone Calls, With More Countries To Come		https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/26/pedius-lets-italys-deaf-make-phone-calls-with-more-countries-to-come/	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
1000	Anthony Ha	Apps	"Tempo is launching a new version of its smart calendar app today with a feature called Insights, which provides a lot more information about the people you’re scheduled to meet.
The app, which first launched a year ago and emerged from research institute SRI (which also incubated voice-powered assistant Siri), already displayed basic information about the people connected to a meeting, like their contact information and links to their social networking profiles.
With the update, however, contact profiles are now split into two tabs: Contact Details and Insights. And the Insights are much more in-depth. They can include information like your most recent email exchanges, past and future meetings, CrunchBase data about the companies they work for, AngelList data, and more information from their social networking profiles.
I asked CEO Raj Singh why Tempo needed to build a separate tab for this, rather than just adding information to the existing profiles, and he said they serve two different purposes — profiles allow you to reach out to someone, while the Insights feature is more about giving you information that helps build relationships: “We’re trying to call out the most important details.”
Another interesting point about Insights is the fact that it takes advantage of the “Tempo graph” — in other words, it’s not just showing mutual connections from LinkedIn and Facebook, but from Tempo as well.
Singh has suggested in the past that he wants to do more with Tempo’s data, turning it into less of a calendar app, per se, and more of a personal assistant built on top of a calendar. Insights and the Tempo Graph move the app further in that direction, as do other additions called Smart Alerts and Morning Alerts.
Like other calendar apps, Tempo could already alert you to upcoming events, but Smart Alerts allow users to perform the most common action associated with a particular meeting type with just one tap — right now, that includes auto-dialing a conference call, checking your flight status, navigating to a location, contacting a person, and reading about a company. (Call me lazy, but I love Tempo’s auto-dialing feature, and now it’s getting even more convenient.) Morning Alerts, meanwhile, aren’t tied to a specific event, but are instead daily reminders to wish friends a happy birthday and review your schedule.
You can download the new Tempo app here."	2014-02-05	953336	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/tempo_insights_phone.png?w=300	startups/	Smart Calendar App Tempo Adds “Insights” Tab To Provide More Social Data About Your Meetings		https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/05/tempo-insights/	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1018	Anthony Ha	Mobile	"Tagwhat tries to connect online content to real-world locations, and it’s taking that idea step further with a new feature that it calls the Superslider.
Co-founder and CEO Dave Elchoness says that there’s an enormous amount of content on the web that’s related to location but not geotagged — which means that you might completely miss the relevance of a neighborhood or building as you pass through. For example, if you’re traveling to New York and you walk past Katz’s Deli, you might miss out on the fact that it’s the setting for the famous “I’ll have what she’s having” scene in When Harry Met Sally. In fact, I’ve been inside the deli several times without knowing that. (I did watch my friends eat a particularly disgusting meal there, so it wasn’t a total loss.)
To solve that problem, Tagwhat has created a collection of geotagged content (the content is either written by the Tagwhat team and the community, or it’s pulled from publishing partners and open sources like Wikipedia) that you can browse on your iPhone or Android. When you open the app, you’re presented with a selection of notable nearby locations — this afternoon I tried it out from the TechCrunch office, and I was able to read a description of The Creamery coffee shop and the Wikipedia article on the 4th and King Caltrain station. You can narrow search to specific channels like “movies” and “Wikipedia,” and you can also bring up a map and directions for each entry.
The Superslider adds a social layer to the experience. After all, if you’re interested in reading about a spot, you may also be interested in seeing who else has checked in there, or who’s tweeting about it. And that’s what the Superslider allows — it’s a slider that you can bring up beneath any Tagwhat entry, allowing you to browse and post related content to Facebook, Foursquare, and Twitter. The algorithm matching locations to social content works well, but it’s not infallible — when I opened the Superslider for the Creamery, I saw the Creamery’s Facebook page (great!), but most all of the tweets were actually related to other locations, like Cold Stone Creamery (less so).

Elchoness says the Superslider will expand over time to include other apps — not just social ones, either. You might be walking past AT&T Park and the Supderslider could bring up the ESPN app showing the latest scores. Ultimately, Elchoness says Tagwhat could become an “app of apps.”
“A lot of folks have been thinking about mobile in the wrong way,” he says. “It needs to be simple and easy to use. No one’s going to be hopping to lots of different apps for very long.”
In addition to the Superslider, Tagwhat has also added a travel log feature, allowing users to mark locations as “been there” and “want to go”, essentially saving those entries in a list for future browsing.
By the way, if the name sounds familiar, it’s because we wrote about Tagwhat back when it was focusing on augmented reality, before the launch of its current apps. You can download the Tagwhat iPhone app here and the Android app here."	2012-08-23	634454	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/tagwhat-app.jpg?w=400	startups/	Tagwhat’s Virtual Tour Guide Gets A Social ‘Superslider’		https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/tagwhat-superslider/	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1019	Steve O'Hear	Apps	"Likemind is another take on solving the ‘how to meet local people with shared interests’ problem. The iOS-only app, with an Android version to follow, lets you post and browse geo-fenced virtual ‘flyers’ outlining what you’re looking for based on topic, interest or activity. It’s a nice visual and modern-day approach to the personal classified ads or pin-board notices of yesteryear. And actually looks quite fun.
At first glance, Berlin-based Likemind would appear to be playing in the same space as ‘people discovery’ sites like Badoo, or ‘people radar’ apps like Highlight, which require you to be within close proximity of the person you may want to go on to meet. Then there’s something like Sonar for meeting people within your existing friend network. But actually, Likemind is different in the sense that, unlike most other services, it isn’t profile-driven. Instead, the SoLoMo networking hangs off the requests outlined in each virtual flyer, rather than a user’s profile.
Those requests can be something very specific, along the lines of ‘Who wants to see that new movie tonight?’ or ‘Running partner needed’, to something as general as ‘I just moved to the city and am looking to meet new people’. Of course, this means that Likemind can also be used for dating, which the startup’s co-founder and CEO Jens-Philipp Klein concedes, though it’s thought that the flyer approach makes the app much more open to a range of uses and requests.
Users sign up to the app through Facebook, providing a degree of accountability and easy profile creation. From there, they can begin posting or responding to flyers. In a neat twist, each flyer can only be corresponded with six times on a first to converse basis — initialising a chat involves ‘tearing off’ one of the six available tabs — so as to provide a degree of exclusivity and to limit the noise for popular flyers. After all of the tabs have been used up, the flyer is ‘paused’ and its author has the option to repost the flyer with one click or post a new one. Users can also be blocked from responding a second time.
“Allowing each user to receive only six replies at a time helps to limit unwanted levels of attention around popular flyers and also distributes activity evenly across the community,” says Klein in a statement.
Unsurprisingly, Likemind employs a freemium model. The app is free to download, while browsing and posting flyers, and starting conversations is also free. However, additional features, such as better interest matching options, flyer targeting or image sharing, requires spending the app’s virtual currency — ‘Likemind Points’ — which need to be bought for real cash or earned by inviting friends to join the service.
Likemind was founded in 2012 and is backed by Christophe Maire and JMES-Investments, and other private investors. It isn’t saying how much it’s raised, except that it falls within “a six figure” euro sum. Yes, that old game."	2013-07-08	843034	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/likemind02_flyer.png?w=400	social/	Likemind Wants To Help You Meet Local People By Posting Virtual Flyers Through Its iOS App		https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/08/likemind/	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
1068	Sarah Perez	Apps	"Connect, a social address book and friend finder application that launched earlier this year, has raised $10.3 million in new funding as the company prepares to expand into messaging, and also to additional international markets including China, Russia and elsewhere. The Series A round includes investment from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Fosun International, the “Berkshire Hathaway” of China, which invests in Silicon Valley through its investment arm Kinzon Capital.
According to Connect co-founder and CEO Ryan Allis, the team was impressed by Kinzon managing director Brad Bao’s experience in a similar space. Bao came to Kinzon from Tencent (WeChat’s creator), and has been studying mobile technology for a decade.
Additionally, Allis is interested in taking the Connect app to international markets including China, which is why an investment from Kinzon/Fosun made sense.
The app, for background, launched in February as an address book of sorts that lets users connect their Google address books as well as other social networks like LinkedIn, Instagram, Foursquare, and Twitter. The app can then display your nearby connections on a map, based on things like check-ins, geo-tagged posts, or more explicitly shared location data. What makes the address book smart, however, is that it lets you also receive alerts for things like when out-of-state friends are visiting town, or if local friends are hanging out nearby, for example.
Since its launch, Connect has grown to 2.5 million users, and now sees just under 1 million monthly actives, despite being limited to the iOS platform.
Now with the new funding, Connect is preparing to also launch on Android in Q1 2015, then expand via localized versions to other markets. Unlike some other apps and games, localization for Connect means more than just handling translations – other regions of the world will have different sets of social services made available to them. For instance, Chinese users may be offered the option to find their friends from WeChat, Renren, or Baidu, and while in Russia, it may integrate with Vkontakte.ru.
Another big change for Connect is that the company will also be expanding to become more of a communications platform starting next year.
“The word ‘connect’ for us literally means connecting all your contacts into one place, then having a tool – whether it be video, whether it be audio, whether it be SMS – any method of communications can and will go through Connect in the future,” Allis explains. “That’s where we’re going – into the WeChat, Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger market.”
The goal is to eventually offer messaging features like video calling, he says, but admits that in terms of true interoperability with other third-party services, the app is limited by those that don’t have an open API. But wherever APIs are available, Connect will use them.
Further down the road in 2016, the company plans to introduce its revenue model. Instead of going the ad-supported route, the current plan is to have Connect make money via payments, and by bringing people together in the real-world – like by pointing friends to local events, splitting a restaurant bill with friends, or connecting to Uber from within the app.
Now a 14-person team based in San Francisco, Connect is also expanding its engineering, biz dev and executive ranks thanks to the new funding.
As a number of companies, including Facebook and LinkedIn, have been breaking apart their larger social networks into a suite of smaller applications for mobile, Connect will either succeed or fail by pursuing an entirely different philosophy.
“We think what’s best for the user is one application that combines all communications and interactions with friends,” says Allis. “That’s something nobody else has done yet.”"	2014-12-10	1091216	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/iphone_3up.png?w=738	mobile/	Social Address Book Connect Raises $10.3M As It Expands Into Messaging, International Markets		https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/10/social-address-book-connect-raises-10-3m-as-it-expands-into-messaging-international-markets/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1074	Josh Constine	Apps	"Sunsets? Landscapes? Latte art? Look back at your old photos and you’ll notice they’re boring unless there’s a human face in them. Now think about teens on social media. Immaturity fuels bullying and drama-filled comment reels. So RockLive has taken funding from Justin Bieber to solve these problems with Shots of Me, a self-portrait photo sharing iOS app that launches today.
Selfies — photos you shoot of yourself, often with the front-facing camera. That’s what you do on Shots of Me. Take selfies. Share selfies to the app’s Instagram-style internal social network or to Twitter (with Instagram sharing coming soon). Like Selfies from other people.
Yes, you read that right. It’s a social network entirely for selfies. The premise is simple, but it hides the amount of work and detail that went into Shots of Me.
“We were creating these games and had a good, young demographic. Always high schoolers,” RockLive CEO John Shahidi tells me. “We giggled that we knew how to market to high school girls so let’s build something even bigger,” he says.

The idea for Shots of Me came from Shahidi looking at the photo app craze and realizing “People enjoy looking at humans. Not just yourself. People like looking at other people. It doesn’t ever really get old. Looking at a coffee or salad…”, Shahidi trails off, but the implication is clear. Instagram is the home for photos of food and inanimate object photography, as the filters make them look interesting. But they’re not. And people are sick of staring at your lunch.
Does the world need another photo app? Maybe not. But if you suspend your skepticism for a moment, seeing the smiling faces of your friends more often probably isn’t such a bad thing.
RockLive’s five-person team began building Shots of Me in May and today it becomes available for download. Open the iOS-only app and you’ll find a full-screen feed of selfies from your Shots of Me friends and anyone you pull from your Twitter contacts.
In a cool chameleon design trick, the name/location and caption/likes bars above and below each photo take on the colors of the pic and change as you scroll. It’s like you’re looking through a steamy window. Shahidi proclaims “We want to be a top of the line product. You spend $500 on a phone. Does this app fit the quality of the iPhone, does this feel like a like Mercedes or a Ferrari?” That might be pushing it, but the app has number of flourishes like letting you pick the color of the navigation chrome.
To enforce the selfies-only rule, you have to take photos using the front-facing camera. And similar to Snapchat, you can only shoot Shots of Me within the app. No uploading means the emotions you see in a newly uploaded Shot Of Me is how that person is feeling right now.
What makes Shots of Me functionally unique is actually what it lacks: Comments. “People share photos because they felt so positive at that moment” Shahidi explains. “Drama kills that moment.”
If someone makes fun of your photo of the ocean, whatever. But selfies leave people vulnerable. A hateful comment about your face could really hurt, especially if you’re a sensitive teenager. So rather than comments, Shots of Me has a direct messaging system where you can ping anyone who follows you, similar to Twitter. This way, any drama stays private and randos can’t troll you.
[Update: After some more real-world usage, I find myself really resonating with the idea that photos with people in them are more fun. I think two pictures I might have taken of dead things over the last day (a theater marquee, a T-Rex statue) were much better with my silly face in them.
Still, there are some nagging design flaws in Shots of Me. As you can see above, the navigation buttons obscure the caption and likes bar beneath each photo. Also, the like button is far too small, making it a chore to hit, which reduces the interaction and notifications Shots of Me needs to grow. It also leads to accidental taps into the accounts of other people who liked a selfie. These need to be cleared up as soon as possible.]
It was this philosophy of positivity that attracted Justin Bieber to Shots of Me. The pop star was introduced to the RockLive and Shots of Me, and Shahidi says “Honestly, he loved it. He was a bit annoyed by other platforms” referring to the constant homophobic slurs and hate Justin gets on Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks.
“The commenting thing was something he really cared about. Not just for himself, but for the kids. He said ‘I want a platform where my fans don’t have to deal with this. We didn’t ask him for money. He said ‘I want to be part of this.'”
RockLive had already raised $1.6 million from Shervin Pishevar, boxer Floyd Mayweather, early Apple employee Tom McInerney and NALA investments. NALA had set terms to put in some more money, but RockLive let Bieber in at the last minute to let him contribute the majority of the $1.1 million second round.
This is Bieber’s first publicly announced personal investment without the help of his manager Scooter Braun, who he’s invested in a few startups with. Shahidi says Bieber “did a lot of due diligence. He asked a lot of questions and he calls all the time.”There’s no business model to analyze, though, as Shots of Me is focused solely on growth, which will be a tough fight.
Some will undoubtedly say Bieber has no business investing in tech, but if he can consistently sell millions of record and huge numbers of concert tickets, he must have a knack for understanding what kids want.
Overall, Shots of Me feels refreshing because every face is fascinating. There are no botched attempts at artful photos of stale scenes cluttering the feed. Sure, Shots of Me could become a vehicle for vanity, but that’s human nature. You can say it will fail. You can say it’s dumb. But it doesn’t change the fact that people are taking selfies at an alarming rate. Someone’s going to capitalize. Some say selfies are a fad, but we’ve been painting and shooting portraits for a long, long time.
The question now is whether Shots of Me’s focus on selfies, no-drama feed, and aid from the Bieber-nation will be enough to carve out an audience amongst the slew of other photo apps.
Most obviously, Shots of Me will be taking on Instagram and its 150 million highly engaged users. Then there are stalwarts Facebook and Twitter. Snapchat has become a destination for sharing silly self-portraits, and maybe the mysterious, unlaunched startup “Selfie” will seduce some users.
The biggest threat may be the recently launched Frontback, which cleverly lets you share two-photo diptychs that feature a front-facing selfie plus a rear-facing shot to show where you are. With 300,000 downloads since its launch in August and $3 million in new funding, Frontback is capitalizing on its unique format. It permits funny photo mashups, also prohibits comments, and combines eye-catching faces with added context. Beating out all these apps will be a serious challenge.
Shahidi remains confident, noting that “Taking one photo is already a lot of work” and that the non-selfie part of Frontbacks could get stale because “people are typically doing the same thing every day. If you’re in the office, the office is kind of boring”. RockLive actually considered offering the diptych style, but concluded “There’s more opportunities to take photos of yourself than figuring out the other side.”
With any luck, Shots of Me will get Bieber to share selfies exclusively on its app to attract some of his 47 million Twitter followers and 57 million Facebook fans. It could blow past Frontback if just 1 percent of those people checked out Shots of Me. Still, Shahidi hopes his product can stand on its own two feet.
“Before Instagram, there were dozens of apps that could let you take photos with filters, but Instagram was the first to create a home for your filtered pictures. You knew you were going to see elegant photos.” He hopes Shots Of Me will do the same for selfies. “People are going to enjoy seeing their life documented through the app. They’re your memories. If you’re not in the photo, it didn’t happen.”

1114	Ron Miller	Mobile	"As a big sports fan, I know fans love their teams with an unbridled passion and they may drive their friends who don’t share their view a little crazy by filling their social feeds with commentary on the latest game. For like-minded fans, this is great fun, but for your other friends, not so much. What if you could engage with just your sports-fan friends in a social network just for you? That’s what Fancred is trying to do -and they got $3M today to continue to build their product.
The additional funding brings the total to-date to $4.5M. This round includes existing investors Atlas Ventures and Militello Capital, as well as first timer Breakaway Innovation Group. Linda Pizzuti Henry, wife of Red Sox and Boston Globe owner John Henry was an early seed investor.
Co-founder and CEO Kash Razzaghi says at its core, Fancred is an iOS app designed to help fans capture their favorite sports moments and share them with others who have similar enthusiasm for sports. This could actually involve going to a game and sharing pictures and thoughts as you watch the game live, or meeting a bunch of fans from your alma mater at a bar every Saturday during college football season to watch your team together and sharing thoughts and moments from the scene. It could also be fans watching a game at home and posting their impressions throughout the game, while interacting with like-minded people who are watching too.
Whatever the venue, as a natural result of participating you build up a profile with your favorite sports moments. Participants are given a Fancred rating of between 1 and 100 based on how active they are in the Fancred community and Razzaghi says the company hopes that will motivate people to participate more to increase their scores and build their community credibility.
He says the company’s goal is to eventually build the world’s largest sports social network.
Razzaghi acknowledges that people are having these kinds of interactions on Facebook and Twitter too, and he doesn’t want to replace that so much as provide a separate place for sports fans. He says getting people to use a niche social product like his when Facebook and Twitter have size in their favor is a huge challenge, but he believes that products like Instagram and Snapchat show it can be done.
“We aren’t saying don’t talk sports on Facebook and Twitter,” but he says what makes Fancred different is that it builds that portfolio of your favorite moments, a digital scrapbook of sorts and that’s something Facebook and Twitter can’t really do well. Plus he says, you have the community effect too where you can meet other fans.
Fancred today is available just as an iOS app, but they want to expand their engineering staff with this round and build an Android app to continue to grow the community. They aren’t sharing community numbers at the moment, but they are actively working to build a Fancred user base with a network of 150 college interns who are working at a grassroots level at colleges around the country to get young people to use the app, which is an innovative and proactive way of building community quickly.
In terms of monetization, the company has a number of ideas, but short-term it wants to build the community before it decides on a definitive direction. Razzaghi said there are a number of areas they could attack including selling fan gear or selling aggregated data about fans. For instance, he says college and pro teams don’t really know who their fans are. If you have a regular group of folks meeting on a weekly basis to watch their favorite college football team, there could be value in the college understanding that.
Fancred was started in 2012 by some former Brightcove employees, emerging in 2013 from the Boston Techstars startup incubator. Today it has 11 full time employees plus the network of interns."	2014-08-21	1046879	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/12245750054_c7ad71411b_k.jpg?w=738	mobile/	Fancred Gets $3M To Continue Building Social Network Just For Sports Fans		https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/21/fancred-gets-3m-to-continue-building-social-network-just-for-sports-fans/	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1146	Jordan Crook	Apps	"In the last year, Tinder packaged the experience of making eyes at someone across a bar and put it right on your phone. But if you’ve ever actually gone through with the eyes-in-a-bar experience, you know it can be hit or miss.
Willow, a new app launching to the App Store, asks users to make a connection based around who you are, not how you look. Instead of showing a feed full of selfies, Willow’s feed is full of questions. Users can ask anything that will be thrown into the feed, and users can respond to questions they find interesting or alluring.
Once a question has been answered, pictures are revealed.
The idea here, according to founder Michael Bruch, is that most dating networks suffer from the fact that it’s hard to start a conversation online with a stranger. In Willow, users are actually connecting by starting a conversation, getting that out of the way right from the get-go.
Like most dating apps, users can set preferences based around location, gender and age, with the added benefit of selecting intentions (casual conversation, friendship, romance, etc.) The app also lets you search questions by category so that you can find someone with mutual interests.
More than 100,000 people downloaded Willow during the beta, and the company is focused on user growth wholeheartedly before making any decisions about monetization. Thus far, Willow is entirely bootstrapped.

1184	Josh Constine	Apps	"In case there was any doubt that Snapchat wants to be the mobile generation’s mass media, it’s just added Cosmopolitan Editor-In-Chief Joanna Coles to its board of directors. She joins Snapchat investor Benchmark’s Mitchell Lasky, Sony’s Michael Lynton, and founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy.
Cosmo and the startup were already connected as the women’s magazine runs a Snapchat Discover channel. Coles also interviewed Spiegel on stage at Cannes last year. WWD reported the news and Snapchat has confirmed to me the addition.
For Snapchat to turn all its attention into a business, it needs to find a way to merge advertising with its content. That’s a challenge since much of what’s watched on Snapchat is amateur-made clips sent between friends or posted on Stories. Injecting ads into these experiences could feel interruptive and uncool.

Coles could bring her insight from Cosmo and being an editorial director of Seventeen magazine. She understands how to find advertisers that match youthful demographics so they blend in. Her connections in the media business surely won’t hurt either.
Cosmo’s also known for its punchy, bite-sized content. Unlike more text-heavy magazines whose style wouldn’t fit on Discover, Cosmo’s quick hits of pop news and instructive beauty tips feel digestible on Snapchat. As a board member, Coles could aid Snapchat in teaching other brands how to feel like a natural part of Snapchat."	2016-01-26	1267960	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/joanna-coles.png?w=738	mobile/	Snapchat Spruces Up Its Board With Cosmopolitan Editor Joanna Coles	snapchat	https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/snapchat-board-of-directors/	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1187	Jordan Crook	Advertising Tech	"Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel has kept quiet about how Stories, the app’s new 24-hour timeline play, might turn into a monetization route. 
Forget the fact that Snapchat has released some of its first-ever commercials, and that those commercials were in collaboration with local LA bands. Don’t mind the fact that Snapchat has sent users these commercials with a direct link to the music of those bands on the iTunes store. It’s not a big step towards monetization. It’s “just a little experiment,” says Spiegel. 
This morning, after unveiling Stories, Team Snapchat (Snapchat’s version of @Twitter on Twitter) has just sent out a message with one of the music videos inside, from Smallpools. At the end of the commercial, the user returns to the inbox, but instead of seeing a line of text under the snap that says “opened” it instead says “Double tap to listen.”
Users who double tap the message will instantly be sent to the Smallpools iTunes page.
If that’s not a step toward monetization, I don’t know what is.
“If anything, it’s a little experiment,” Spiegel told TechCrunch. “We wanted to work with LA bands, celebrate Los Angeles, and we thought working with them was a fun way to educate people about what stories are. Plus, it’s a good way for users to hear their music.”
It certainly is a good way to get Snapchat’s entire user base a direct link to purchase music they’ve just heard, sent directly to them from Snapchat itself.
In a conversation with The Verge, Spiegel reportedly smiled at the idea of music artists having the ability to share their days with users, as you have the option to share Stories with just friends or everyone. Furthermore, Snapchat users have the option to choose what goes into their Story and what remains a private, instantly disappearing message.
With the double click to listen feature, artists would have the opportunity to be personal with their fans and then leverage that personal connection into a sale almost instantly.
It’s still unclear whether or not Snapchat itself will be administering the click-to-buy functionality (through Team Snapchat), or if brands and artists can pay for the ability to add a “double click to listen” link under their own messages. For now, it seems that Snapchat is testing out the feature through the Team Snapchat username.
There are two sides to this, though. Team Snapchat hits the entire user base of Snapchat, which currently sends 350 million snaps per day, whereas individual artists must be added manually. Users who specifically follow artists may be a more valuable consumer of that Snap Story, and thus more likely to make a purchase at the end. With Team Snapchat versus individual artists, it’s quantity over quality.
When asked about the potential for brands to get their hands on the “double click to listen” feature, Spiegel said that Snapchat “has not thought that far down the road yet.”
Where Stories are concerned, Spiegel explained that the service is meant to be a representation of your actual life, rather than your digital life alone. That’s why everything is chronological, something he expressed as important back at Disrupt SF during an on-stage interview, and that’s why videos and photos are combined. “That kind of excitement and movement that you feel is something we hadn’t seen before in broadcast social media,” said Speigel.
The CEO said that soon, users will have custom control over who can see their stories, rather than offering just the two options of friends and everyone. He also noted that users can always see who is viewing their story, the same way Snapchat shows you when someone has opened your snap.
The idea here comes back to digital dualism, or the idea that our digital lives are separate from our real-world lives, something Spiegel loathes.
“We noticed that, even though one person is paying attention to another person’s social feed, they’ll pretend that they haven’t been paying attention in real life,” said Spiegel. “We wanted to make that real life interaction less awkward and more transparent.”
It’s also worth noting that Snapchat’s web profiles, showing a user’s best friends list (www.snapchat.com/jordanrcrook) have migrated to now show 404 errors. Speigel says that the company just wanted to move the best friends’ list into the app. The question, then, is why remove the web profiles, if there’s nothing to change about them? It doesn’t harm the native app experience to have web counterparts for that information, right? 
Spiegel denies any changes to the profile pages, but the idea of 24-hour expiring timelines as the backbone profile pages of a web version of Snapchat sure does make sense.

1238	Mahesh Sharma	Apps	" Carrying the weight of expectation attached to securing $11.9 million funding in its first few months of operation, MessageMe has switched on the ability to send and receive stickers — an increasingly popular medium which has sparked a multi-million dollar gold rush for messaging app developers.
MessageMe switched on the functionality overnight in the iOS App Store, allowing users to send detailed cartoons when they chat with their friends, in addition to the ability to seamlessly send rich media such as photos, music, and doodles.
The start-up, which was co-founded by LOLapps founder Arjun Sethi in March, and within months raised $11.9 million from a series of high-profile investors, is the latest messaging app to jump on the sticker bandwagon.
Japan’s Line booked $27.4 million in sticker sales in Q2 results announced today, almost double the previous quarter; and it sold almost as much in sponsored sticker packs. And in the first 24 hours after its sticker launch, Path made more money than it had in its entire lifetime as a company. Meanwhile, Facebook — who blocked MessageMe days after launch because it too closely resembled its own Messenger App — launched branded stickers in late June. The social networking giant doesn’t charge for stickers, and recently offered a Despicable Me image pack to coincide with the film’s release."	2013-08-08	858275	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/img_2101.jpg?w=320	startups/	MessageMe Introduces Stickers To Keep Pace With Competition		https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/08/messageme-stickers/	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1246	Josh Constine	Apps	"Twitter co-founder Biz Stone’s Q&A app Jelly didn’t quite blow up, so today he’s launching a much weirder app called Super where you can share colorful statements, opinions and recommendations. It’s a lot like the private beta version of Super I stumbled into and profiled in September, but now everyone on iOS and Android can start yelling in all caps about their thoughts.

 
With Super, you choose from a prompt like The Best, I Am, I Wish, or Definitely Don’t, add an image or choose one suggested according to the keywords in your post, and select whether to sign your name or be “anonymish”. Your Super post gets shown in the Friends feed to people connected to you via your phone number, Facebook, or Twitter. You can also browse a best-of Everyone feed, or see posts from Nearby.
A slew of apps like State and Amen have ended up the dumpster or with very little traffic after trying to capture “opinion sharing”. Those that have survived, like Secret and Whisper, have leaned heavily on the defining trait of anonymity. Though it’s constrained by the prompts, Super might still lack the uniqueness to make people adopt another social feed. With its more generalist approach, Super’s biggest competition might not be any of the dedicated opinion apps, but instead what he already built: Twitter.
That why Stone’s trying his best to manage expectations for the app, writing he’s “not going to proclaim that it’s the most innovative thing ever or that it’s going to save the world. It’s not, it’s just fun.” He follows up with me that “You can’t come out of the gates and say ‘we’re going to change the world’. You just have to make something and see if people like it.”
That’s a lot different from Stone’s flashy, rhetoric-heavy launch of Jelly, where he touted the app’s potential to make everyone more empathetic…by helping people identify landmarks they snapped pictures of on the way to work. In the end, not enough people liked it.
Stone says Jelly’s Q&A app will live on, though the only update currently planned is some iOS 8 bug fixes. “We’re going to keep it there, because the people who use it, love it. I don’t see why we’d get rid of it. It’s a cool little app. When it works, it really works.” It just wasn’t working for a sufficient number of people to bet the farm on.
What Stone learned, though, was that people enjoyed answering questions. “Turns out people really love to put their opinions on the Internet. Go figure”, he jokes.
Stone exclaims “Fun is the way to go. You don’t want to not have fun at work, right?”
Yes, that’s quite the privileged statement, afforded by Stone’s stake in a company worth tens of billions of dollar. No, most people go to work to make money because they don’t already have gobs of it.
But Stone’s philosophy also illustrates a growing trend of post-exit entrepreneurs experimenting with consumer mobile app design.
Rather than trying to build a serious business, they’re using the financial freedom from past successes to bankroll a more playful approach. It prioritizes the happiness of the founders with the expectation that if they’re having fun, so will users.
Like casual, mass-market moonshots, there’s a high likelihood that apps like Super or Kevin Rose’s Tiiny will fail. But instead of building hard science technologies like Google’s moonshots, they’re social apps angling to be the next Instagram or Snapchat.
Stone recounts an old Charles Eames quote, “Toys are not really as innocent as they look. Toys and games are the preludes to serious ideas.” Stone’s version, which he says he learned from building Twitter, is that “if something’s fun, people might use it, and if enough people use it, it could be important.”

1253	Jordan Crook	Apps	"Video apps are sprouting up like weeds, but Vine and Instagram still hold the majority share of video creation on mobile. However, there’s one thing that both of these services are lacking: a voiceover tool.
But a new startup is looking to remedy that. World, meet JamCam.
JamCam doesn’t let you use any old audio over your video. However, imagine this. You’re walking along the street, or riding in the car. The scenery is beautiful, and the song playing on your iPhone couldn’t be more perfect. All you want is to share this harmony with your friends, but alas, opening up Vine or Instagram kills the music instantly, opting instead for the odd noises of your surroundings.
With JamCam, the video you record automatically adds the song you were listening to on the iPhone (as a raw file) to the video. You edit just like on Vine, by threading together various shots with a few choice taps of the thumb, and the app automatically adds in the music based on the same rhythm of your edits.
It works like this:
When you open up the app, you’ll first be asked to switch the phone into landscape mode. Once in landscape, you’ll be reminded of the song you had playing on the bottom bar of the phone, with a button on the right for recording. On the left, you have options for front-facing camera and using flash.
When you hold down the record button, the song begins playing and stops when you release. Videos last 15 seconds, just like Instagram, to allow for enough of the song to play.
Here’s one of the videos I made.
The app only allows DRM-unlocked songs to work in the app, so founder Matt Loszak doesn’t get himself in trouble. I’ve found the app, freshly launched by a team of one in Canada, is more reliable when you use headphones. Users can share to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram through a link, or have the option to save the video. Thanks to Instagram’s generous option to let us upload video, you can actually upload your JamCam vids direct to the photo sharing service.
That said, JamCam needs some work on the sharing side, as it’s a slow process and takes far too many steps.
If you’re interested in making some music-inspired mobile video, check out the JamCam app in the App Store."	2013-10-04	888514	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/screen-shot-2013-10-04-at-10-16-53-am.png?w=203	startups/	JamCam App Lets You Use Songs In Your Mobile Videos		https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/04/jamcam-app-lets-you-use-songs-in-your-mobile-videos/	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1278	Anthony Ha	Apps	"Nuzzel, the social news startup led by Friendster founder Jonathan Abrams, says it has raised $1.7 million in new funding.
The news follows the launch of the Nuzzel iPhone app a month ago. Abrams told me via email that the company had only spent about half of its original seed funding (which also totaled $1.7 million), but there was “additional investment interest from some really interesting folks,” so he decided to raise a second seed round.
The core concept behind Nuzzel is pretty straightforward — it makes it easy to see the news stories that have been most-shared by your friends on Twitter and Facebook. (You can expand beyond those stories by looking at headlines shared by friends of friends, or at the news feeds of individual users.)
Thanks to last month’s launch, not only did Nuzzel finally have a smartphone app, but it also added what’s become my favorite feature, news alerts about stories that are tweeted by lots of your friends. (Twitter has experimenting with similar alerts, though only for TV-related conversations so far.)
Abrams recently blogged about how the iPhone app got featured in Apple’s App Store, and he also highlighted some of the buzz, including some positive commentary from yours truly and from some folks who turned out to be investors in the new round. Homebrew’s Hunter Walk called it the “best social news app” while Lowercase Capital’s Chris Sacca said he “uses it every single day.” (Abrams told me Walk, Sacca, and Homebrew’s Lowercase’s Matt Mazzeo were all “super-active Nuzzel users prior to investing.”)
The main purpose of the funding is to hire new engineers — the Nuzzel team is four people, and Abrams is hoping to hire three more.
Here’s the list of new investors (previous backers also participated) that Abrams gave me:"	2014-06-12	1015372	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_7217.jpg?w=738	social/	Social News Aggregator Nuzzel Raises $1.7M From Lowercase, Homebrew, And Others		https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/12/nuzzel-new-funding/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1285	Sarah Perez	Apps	"A blog post from Flickr about new updates to its iOS application went relatively unnoticed yesterday. The post announced a series of incremental improvements to an app which has so far barely managed to catch up to the competition after months of abandonment, but has yet to really impress. The latest build brings a few now-standard features like the ability to save photos to your Camera Roll, communicate with @ replies, and more.
It’s nothing to write home about, so to speak, which is why the majority of the news-hungry tech blogs didn’t prioritize it on a day when Google was announcing new hardware (a high-end Chrome OS laptop called the Pixel, which actually does impress).

That being said, Flickr is still an important network to watch, especially because it has managed to maintain a foothold and consumer brand, even as Facebook has triumphed as the de facto place where users now go to upload and share photos with family and friends. Flickr, had it not been starved for innovation inside the machinery of a floundering Yahoo, could have even competed with Facebook, given its head start, once highly engaged user base, and massive collection of some 8 billion+ photos.
The tech blogosphere is now rooting for new Flickr and new Yahoo, given that we all like new CEO Marissa Mayer just so darned much. But if the company waited a year before the app update that arrived in December introducing the world to Yahoo’s new vision for Flickr, maybe it should have waited a little longer until it really had something radical and new to show us.
Don’t get me wrong.
Flickr is no longer a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad app, as it was pre-December revamp. The older version was a slow, buggy destroyer of image quality. And worse, it forced you to upload photos one-by-one. Yes, in 2012.
Meanwhile, the new Flickr for iOS is an entirely different application. It’s fast, solid and well-built with a smart and attractive user interface, and even some trendier features like filters.
Yes, filters are trendy. Ten years from now, I imagine we’ll look back on them and giggle a little about the hipster-fied 2010’s, with our skinny jeans and insta-aged photos. Filters, after all, are a way to evoke nostalgia in an age where everything moves a bit too quickly, and no one has time to pause and reflect. When the coldness of digital photography and the ease and ubiquity of camera phones means we now have 50 pictures of a moment when we used to have one. Filters are a way of saying to ourselves: stop, this moment is important. I’m selecting it specifically. I’m differentiating it from the stream.

Filters are solving the problem of too much/too fast, but that’s a problem that will eventually be solved by smarter technology. And Flickr would have done well to launch an app that was, at the very least, heading in that direction when it re-birthed itself over the holidays.
As it stands today, the app is instead seemingly working on a list of checkboxes of what a photo-sharing, social mobile application should be about. Does it have filters? CHECK. Can you @ reply to friends? CHECK. Share to the social web? CHECK. Post to Tumblr? CHECK. Save photos locally? CHECK. Multi-upload? CHECK.
What it hasn’t done yet is really surprise us.
A number of startups have tried, failed and are continuing to try to make sense of our fragmented, vast and exponentially growing photo collections. Facebook, too, is quietly experimenting in this area, following Google+ and Dropbox’s lead by introducing automatic, background-enabled photo uploads. The feature is always optional, however, as today, users worry about privacy and bandwidth issues. These concerns will reduce in time, especially as micro-networks like Snapchat pop up to provide outlets for private sharing at the same time as bandwidth costs decrease.
Flickr not only needs automatic uploads – that’s just another box to check – it needs to really innovate on the next step. That is, what to do with those photos once they’re in the cloud. A basic first move is automatically creating date and time-stamped photo albums (in Flickr’s parlance, “sets”). But there are many steps that would have to come afterwards. For example:
This is off the top of my head, so I’m sure Yahoo has these things in its sights at least.
What’s odd to me is that it didn’t come running out of the gate really nailing at least one of the above, when each item listed is currently in development by a photo-sharing startup somewhere. Everpix, for example, is tackling the problem of filtering the bad photos from the good and building object-recognition algorithms. Tracks helps you find photo streams that match your interests. Flock, Moment.me, Flayvr, new arrival Albumatic, and others group photos from you and friends (or strangers) based on time and place. Timehop and just-acquired Memolane let you delve into photos of days past.
The technology is out there, it’s just a matter of finding everyone’s price tag. And Flickr should because the time to catch up with other photo apps was over two years ago. Now is the time to out-innovate them or die trying.
Because the story we want to hear is not how Yahoo killed Flickr; we want to hear how Yahoo saved it.

1383	Rip Empson	Apps	"Back in August, Lift launched the first rendition of its snappy-looking iPhone app that aims to help people build healthy habits and achieve their goals. Initially incubated and seed funded by Obvious Corp., the hybrid accelerator and seed vehicle created by Twitter co-founders Ev Williams and Biz Stone and early Twitter VP Jason Goldman, the startup added $2.5 million from Spark Capital, SV Angel and Adam Ludwin from RRE, among others, in November.
Today, Tony Stubblebine, Jon Crosby and team are making their goal-tracking app available to everyone by bringing it to the browser. Up until now, Lift has been iPhone-only, but beginning today, users will be able to sign up for an account and use the app across Windows and Android phones.
The browser version of Lift includes many of the same features that have been available on mobile, including tracking, streaks, graphs, progress and community support, as Stubblebine explained in a blog post this morning.
As we’ve written previously, Lift is among a new set of startups experimenting with the best ways to present behavioral design on mobile — to “find the right incentivization and motivation structures” that can help people better achieve their goals.
Many companies have opted to take a health-centric approach to activity tracking, offering monetary rewards or social graph-leveraged peer pressure to help people unlock healthier lifestyles. Using methods inspired by the Quantified Self Movement’s penchant for data tracking, psychology and behavioral research — along with cheerleading and positive support from its community — Lift is taking a more general approach.
It’s not intended to just be a health-tracking app, although it works in many health-related contexts by helping users keep track of say, the number of push ups they managed in any given week. The team doesn’t want Lift just to be a “tracker” in the same way that many Quantified Self enthusiasts have come to see health trackers as a system bereft of intelligence where users can simply keep tabs and notes about what people do on a daily basis.
And, rather than simply being a habit tracker, which sounds like another chore that people have to suffer through, and because it’s not automatic or daily — the focus of many habit trackers. Instead, users can create or join existing “habits,” using the app to record those habits when and if they meet them. All activity on the app is public, and users can offer support to others (and receive it in kind) when goals are reached.
The idea is to make it simple to record your progress for any and all of your regular habits or activities and get pushed along by the positive reinforcement of community applause. As Lift sucks in more data on your aspirations and progress, it populates groups of charts and graphs with that data, giving users a visual sense of just how well (or not) they’ve been doing when it comes to sticking to their goals.
I like to think of it this way: You know when you make all those brave New Years Resolutions about how you’re going to get in shape and be a better son/daughter/husband/wife/sister/brother/mother/father, stay in touch with friends, be kinder to animals and re-tweet Rip’s articles more regularly? Well, usually, those resolutions are attacked with gusto for about a week before life gets in the way and one month later, you’ve driven by the gym once.
Lift is the app that helps you keep track of all those life goals and remind yourself how close you are to getting there. As Stubblebine writes: “You can’t change what you don’t measure and tracking your progress is the first step toward achievement.” And the second step, going beyond goal tracking, is to make the community foundation deep enough that it becomes a legitimate source of answers, accountability and positive support.
In terms of what Lift is launching today, beyond progress and quick tracking, Lift for the Web includes a “Me” tab that allows users to view trend charts in bar form among others. [See below.]

Lift for the Web is also a product of responsive design, meaning that it’s optimized for mobile use as well, adjusting in size to work with the format and screen type of any mobile device, phone or tablet.
In terms of what’s up next: Lift says that a native Android version of the app isn’t quite ready yet, but it’s on the way. In terms of features, Lift is also testing “expert guidance and accountability in the form of groups,” which Stubblebine says one can think of like “training plans.”
Skeptical? For more about the “Science of Lift,” find it here. But, with its responsive design, Lift (at the very least) keeps the bar high in terms of the clean look and appeal of its simplicity. The team is taking great care not to just create another blunt instrument for health tracking, as seen by the “intelligent” push notification system it launched late last year (care of Matthew Panzarino of TNW), and its user experience is all the better for it.

1485	Sarah Perez	Social	"Apptera, the mobile communications and ad company backed by $30 million from Alloy, Lightspeed Ventures, and others, is today launching a second mobile app to join what had been, until now, its flagship product: the Android dialer replacement, Poptuit, which debuted around this time last year.
The new app is a friend-powered recommendation engine called Raved, and it’s available first for iOS.
The app works by aggregating your Facebook friends’ likes and check-ins, as well as friends’ check-ins from Foursquare, and then presents those to you in a very Pinterest-like interface. There’s a search bar at the top, so you can find places your friends have visited and liked (e.g. search for “sushi,” “coffee,” “gym,” etc.). However, the app’s default screen just shows you top recommendations from those two networks, across all categories.
Apptera CEO Henry Vogel tells me that Raved was designed to fill a niche somewhere in between Yelp and Foursquare. There’s a couple of problems with online reviews (like Yelp), he says. “They’re sort of untrustworthy…and they tend to draw the extremes. There are people that really dislike a place and get motivated to write a review, or they really like a place. You have to do a lot of work shifting through the reviews, seeing how many there are, and reading them,” he says. “We think there’s an opening there in augmenting that information…with the information from the people that you know and trust.”
He also points out that on social apps like Foursquare, there’s only a small percentage of users contributing content. That’s why adding Facebook to the mix helps to provide a better view of what all your friends like and recommend. On Facebook, Vogel says there are around 10-15 places that friends have liked, on average. Combined, that leads to a lot more social data the app can access and aggregate.
While the interface is appealing and simple (gotta love that Pinterest grid, right?) and all the above are some valid points, it’s hard to say there’s enough here to really draw users away from Facebook, Foursquare, or other preferred local recommendation apps like Yelp, Google+ Local, AroundMe, etc. While, yes, reviews can be untrustworthy to some extent, the local business reviews apps offer far more detailed information than Raved does at present. And if you’re looking for a friend’s recommendation to put you over the top, Foursquare has enough traction now to generally suffices, even if the active user base (those checking in and writing tips) is small.
However, Raved plans to grow beyond being just a Facebook/Foursquare platform app. In the future, it will include busy news feeds of place activities pulled from those platforms as well as from Twitter, and will determine whether the local business is offering a deal or discount by aggregating from a network of local offers, deal sites, and Facebook Offers. (This also points to the business model, by the way). And Vogel says that plans to integrate services like OpenTable and GrubHub are planned, too, not only to beef up the content, but also to generate affiliate revenue.
Why is a cash-flow positive ad business so interested in building apps, you might ask? “We just think there’s more opportunity and we’re going where the consumers are going with smartphones,” he says. Be on the lookout for more focus on Raved in the near future from this company."	2012-07-19	612091	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/ravedmain.jpg?w=320	social/	Raved Is A Social-Powered Local Recommendations App Built On Facebook & Foursquare		https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/19/raved-is-a-social-powered-local-recommendations-app-built-on-facebook-foursquare/	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1545	Sarah Perez	Apps	"Say what you want about Path and their previous transgressions, but it’s great to see other mobile applications borrowing the interface and animations Path popularized through its stellar design. Tumblr was one of the first big name apps to adopt Path-like pop-out animations (round circles that appear when tapping to create a new post), and now, Pinterest is doing the same in an effort to make repinning, favoriting, and sharing pins easier for users.
In an update to its iOS application, Pinterest has introduced a new interface design where users can press and hold on a pin in their feed, in order to make rounded action buttons appear. However, unlike on Path or Tumblr, Pinterest’s buttons don’t stay visible after you lift your finger – instead you have to slide your finger from where you originally pressed the pin, over to the button you want to use.
Unfortunately, these new animations only show up on items others have pinned, that you now want to engage with in some way. Meanwhile, the process for adding a pin of your own is relatively unchanged – you push the bottom center button and choose what you want to pin from a standard menu offering options like “website,” “camera,” “clipboard” or just “cancel.”
It’s almost as if Pinterest is experimenting with the idea of new interactions here, rather than rolling out a major interface upgrade all at once. By forcing users to press and hold, too, the new animations arrive as optional way of interacting with pins. However, for those mainstream users who are slow to change their ways (i.e., the majority of Pinterest’s user base), they can still pin and share and like from more obvious action buttons on an individual pin’s page itself.
Pinterest’s mobile applications have seen other slow but steady improvements like this over the course of the year, with updates earlier this month which brought pin sharing to iPad and pin search, for example, plus previous updates which finally solved the problem of being able to pin websites, and the addition of things like enhanced pins with pricing info and availability (oh yes!), upgrades to group pin boards, push notifications, and new discovery mechanisms.
Pinterest Moves Toward A Business Model
Pinterest doesn’t make a lot of buzz about its mobile app updates, generally speaking, but it does when it matters. For instance, it’s worth noting that Pinterest’s new pin suggestion feature is launching on mobile at the same time as web.
In fact, the Pinterest app’s update text in iTunes says this feature is actually included with the latest update, noting that users can now “tap edit Home Feed to easily add and remove stuff from their home feed (iPhone).” Oddly, I’m not yet seeing the option appear following the app update, but your mileage may vary. Pinterest said this would arrive in over the next few weeks, so it could be a staged rollout. (Update: Pinterest confirms this is the case.)

While new animations are enjoyable, this forthcoming feature update is the real deal.
Pinterest recently announced it would begin tracking user activity including those who utilize its “Pin It” button on external websites, while simultaneously allowing users to opt-out. The move is meant to personalize the experience for visitors with better pin and board recommendations, but it also serves as a way for Pinterest’s business customers to target users by pointing them to their own relevant user accounts and boards. In the example Pinterest had provided, someone pinning a lot of vegetarian recipes from around the web would be introduced to other popular boards on the site. This could enable a whole new way for interest-based social advertising to exist outside of Facebook’s likes and Twitter’s own attempts at building the interest graph.
This startup is a great example of the kind of mainstream and accessible technology which is still largely lacking in the industry at present. The service presents itself to end users as an engaging time sink, where they can find things that matter to them – “them” being mainly female users who are pinning and sharing things related to fashion, children and family, recipes and cooking, home decor and design, arts and crafts and DIY, and other topics which everyday people care about – and yes, still generally, everyday women.
As pinners’ involvement with the service grew, businesses began to feel the effects – many e-commerce sites now point to Pinterest as being among the top referral mechanisms from social media services.
Pinterest is no small potatoes, either – it had grown to some 50 million monthly uniques by the time of its $200 million Series D. That’s smaller than Twitter, which has some 200+ monthly actives, but it’s growing still."	2013-07-31	854135	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/photo-23.png?w=400	mobile/	Pinterest’s Mobile App Gets Path-Like Animations, Personalization Options Via New Pin Suggestions		https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/31/pinterests-mobile-app-gets-path-like-animations-readies-personalization-options/	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1577	Anthony Ha	Mobile	"Thirst, an app that helps users get caught up with important news as it’s shared on Twitter, is expanding beyond the iPad today with the launch of a “universal” app that works on the iPhone and iPod Touch, too.
Thirst launched in May, and as co-founder and CEO Anuj Verma tells me, its goal for the current app is to bring people up-to-speed on the most important Twitter updates. So when you open Thirst, you get a personalized “newspaper” with the hottest news stories since the last time you opened the app — which could be an hour or a week ago.
Behind the scenes, Verma says Thirst has developed a natural language processor that determines which tweets are related to a given news topic, regardless of the exact words used. As an example, Verma says that on the day of the Supreme Court decision on healthcare, Thirst automatically aggregated all of the related tweets, whether they used a specific phrase (“Obamacare”, “health care”, “SCOTUS”, etc.) or not.
You can also tweet links and commentary from within the app, with Thirst suggesting the most appropriate hashtag for a given topic.
Verma demonstrated the iPhone version for me last week. The look and functionality are pretty similar to the iPad version — it’s just that instead of splitting a single screen into multiple columns for navigation and content, you now swipe between different screens.
With today’s launch, Thirst is also adding a “featured” section to the app. The initial Thirst interface took a personalized approach to news — tweets from the accounts you follow that were posted since your last visit. As Verma puts it, the featured story section is more like the front page of a newspaper, presenting a more general view of the most important topics today, regardless of who you follow. (The front page metaphor gets a bit confusing, since it’s the personalized view that’s called a “newspaper” in Thirst’s navigation.)
As Verma has said before, the company’s vision goes beyond any one social network. He says it made sense to start with Tweets: “Let’s start with the hardest one first.” That’s because a tweet, with only 140 characters, provides relatively little of the context that helps Thirst understand “what it might be about.” Now that Thirst has made its approach work on Twitter, Verma says, “Technology-wise, it won’t be too hard for us to move on” to other types of content — though it sounds like there aren’t any concrete plans.
Verma adds that Thirst’s technology can do more than recommend news articles, with possible expansion into other topics and types of content.
You can download the iOS app here.

1581	Sarah Perez	Apps	"An application called Accounts, live now on iOS to start, is a new attempt at developing a universal address book. While many competitors that have gone before it have focused on aggregating user accounts from the major social networks – like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, Accounts is interesting because it’s trying to catalog the long-tail of users’ social networks. On Accounts, you can add social accounts as niche as Yo, Steam, Fitbit, Reddit, Tango, Venmo and much more, and then determine which group of contacts (Work, Home, School, etc.) are allowed to view that information about you.
The app has been in development for some time, and has gone through a number of revisions since founder Ben Guild first shared his idea with us back in May. This week, it’s launching out of beta on the iTunes App Store, after having iterated on the concept following user feedback.
The idea in and of itself is intriguing. With the rise of mobile messaging apps, many of which we associate with different aspects to our overall identity – Yammer is for work, Snapchat is for fun, for example – our social presence has become fragmented. Few address books out there today allow us to identify, aggregate and connect with all our many accounts.
With the new app, that changes. After sucking in the contacts on your phone, you can go into your profile in the app and add in your username for dozens accounts ranging from social networks to mobile messengers to gaming networks and more. Each account you add can be toggled to be visible or invisible to a particular group, or you can set the account as visible or invisible to “everyone.”
As you make changes to your own accounts, others connected with you have their address books updated too.
This automatically-updating address book idea, of course, has been tried before. From the spammy Plaxo service years ago to more recently, apps like Cobook (acquired by FullContact), Humin or Brewster.

Accounts doesn’t have the polish and user-friendliness of these newer apps, though. Its dark black background makes it seem as if it would be more at home on an Android phone, while the manual effort involved with setting up your own information in Accounts is tedious.
Then there’s the ever-present challenge that faces any address book newcomer: your friends won’t be on this thing, which ultimately limits the usefulness of any proprietary feature that gets built-in. (For example, in Accounts, you can instantly connect with new people in wireless range if your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is turned on. Nifty, but who’s around to connect with? The app could also alert you when friends join new apps, the company says.)
At the end of the day, Accounts leaves me wondering if the big-picture vision is ultimately flawed. Do I really want to aggregate my multiple, niche social identities under one roof then worry about who has access to that information? Maybe it makes more sense to mentally associate the many apps themselves with one identity and develop unique contact lists within each one. Your gamer self is on Xbox Live. Your gym buddies are on Fitbit. Your family is on Apple’s Find My Friends. And so on.
There’s less configuration and permission setting to be done this way, and all you have to think about is the activity at hand: photo-sharing, texting, video chatting, etc., not “who can see this?”
The former I.T. nerd side of me was initially drawn to the permissioning options within Accounts, but just like dragging people into Google+ circles, it’s a cool concept that just doesn’t scale.
Accounts, in my opinion, is an interesting experiment in managing identity, but not one that makes sense for me personally. Your mileage, as they say, may vary.
Accounts is a free download on iTunes.

1585	Kim-Mai Cutler	Apps	"Applifier, a Helsinki and San Francisco-based mobile-social gaming network, added a lot more richness to its user experience this week with Everyplay, a way for gamers to share and replay their greatest moments. Everyplay lets gamers share their favorite titles by recording and replaying sessions of games — like a time they might have gotten a high score.
The company, which is backed by $2 million from MHS Capital, Profounders, Tekes and Lifeline Ventures, says it has racked up interest from about 100 developers in the Everyplay beta so far this week.
The company follows a long line of predecessors like OpenFeint and PapayaMobile, which are all trying to build a mobile-gaming platform which has enough network effects to earn revenue from distributing and monetizing games.
The very biggest multi-billion dollar Japanese gaming companies like GREE and DeNA are trying to do this too, not to mention Facebook, which recently launched ads in the mobile news feed for third-party apps. The very top mobile developers often each spend several millions of dollars per month in marketing to promote their work. They use gaming networks like Applifier among many other channels.
If a game is in the Everyplay network, a user will see the game-over screen with an option for an instant replay. They have the choice to share it or edit it to show only specific pieces of video while adding in voice or video commentary. After that, they can either share it on the Everyplay network or on Facebook.
Developers can also highlight videos from players on their game page. Gamers can also turn on the front-facing camera to show their reactions when they’re playing the game, but it isn’t on by default.
Before it transitioned onto mobile platforms, Applifier cross-promoted Facebook games through a special wrapper. Then Applifier moved onto the Android and iOS platforms, following a slew of game developers that migrated as Facebook became a more challenging and expensive environment to build and distribute games within.
Everyplay is an extension of Applifier’s mobile gaming cross-promotion network. It faces competition from a Y Combinator-backed startup called Kamcord from the most recent class, that also lets gamers record moments and share them.

1609	Josh Constine	Social	"Facebook didn’t guess that users wanted to share photos. It learned it, Mark Zuckerberg explained in his talk at Y Combinator Startup School. “We really listened to what our users wanted, both qualitatively listening to the words they say, and quantitatively looking at behavior that they take.” Users didn’t necessarily say they wanted photos, but were uploading new profile pics every day.
So Facebook built out photo sharing, it exploded with popularity, and proved that sometimes the data can reveal what users want before they even know it.
That wasn’t the last time Facebook would put turn this practice into product. Hundreds of thousands protested the news feed, but engagement was up, Facebook stuck it out, and news feed became one of the site’s most popular features.
On the other hand, Facebook’s mobile usage kept growing, but all the iOS users were complaining the app was too slow. So Facebook pivoted away from HTML5, rebuilt the app on native architecture, and its App Store rating and engagement climbed. You have to listen to both the words and the numbers.
During his talk with YC founder Paul Graham, Zuckerberg also stressed that entrepreneurs need to give themselves the flexibility to follow what they learn, and what they love. Zuck told the crowd of young entrepreneurs and YC companies at Stanford that “I have this fear of getting locked into doing things that are not the most impactful things you can do.”
That’s why he said “I never understood the idea of wanting to start a company before” knowing what the company should accomplish. “I think people really undervalue the option value in flexibility.”
Zuckerberg then advised would-be entrepreneurs to “Explore what you want to do before committing. Keep yourself flexible. You can definitely do that in the framework of a company, but you have to be weary of working at a company and getting locked in. You’re going to change what you do.” Zuckerberg wasn’t even sure Facebook would be a business. As our writer Colleen Taylor details, Zuckerberg thought Facebook was just a hobby at first.

If you think you have an idea, make sure it’s going to have a big impact. Zuckerberg said that “One of the lessons is…do something fundamental. A lot of companies I see are operating on small problems, and that’s fine if you want to be an entrepreneur, but the most interesting things operate on a fundamental level.”
And if someone new enters your market with unique ideas, don’t derail your roadmap chasing them. Otherwise, Zuckerberg said you could end up like Myspace, which ruined itself chasing Facebook. Zuckerberg explained “they felt threatened by us and copied us, and you’re never going to win that way. Companies getting started now that are just trying to copy what other people are doing aren’t successful.

1689	Jordan Crook	Apps	"You’ve likely heard whispers of a company called Wander in the past year. They nabbed $1.2 million, launched out of TechStars, and have since gone relatively quiet.
Until today.
Today Wander is launching a mobile app called Days, which aims to change the way you think of photo-sharing on every basic level.
To start, Days asks you to stop thinking of the moments that are “share-worthy.” On Days, every moment is share-worthy, because the idea is to share the normal, everyday routine of your life. The idea is that people can consume your whole day through photos, as opposed to picking up on little snippets throughout the day.
So as you go through the world snapping photos, Days automatically documents the time and puts them into the “Tuesday” gallery, or whatever day it might be.
Days also isn’t about taking beautiful pictures. It’s about taking a lot of them.
See, founder Jeremy Fisher believes there’s a huge disconnect between the best moments of people’s days and their Instagram feeds. He also feels that it takes far too long to share a single moment when you’re worried about making it visually appealing, as filters and captions pull you out of the moment.
On Days, you aren’t supposed to worry about how beautiful the picture is, but rather that you’ve documented as much of your day as possible.
But here’s the real zinger — nothing on Days is shared in real time. I know, right? Mind. Blown.
“I think people thought real-time was going to be a bigger deal than it actually is,” says Jeremy Fisher of most social and sharing services. “For things like friend-finders it’s a different story, but when you’re photo-sharing, real-time doesn’t actually make a difference.”
In fact, Wander studied Instagram photos tagged with #latergram (signifying that they were shared after the time they were taken) and found that these photos have the same level of engagement from other users as photos shared in the moment. For this reason, Days shows you a countdown clock within the app to the time you can share your day, starting at 5am each morning to ensure that party-goers late night photos don’t show up in the beginning of their Day.
Fisher explained that their beta testers don’t seem to be bothered by the fact that they’re catching up with their friends a day later. In fact, he said sometimes seeing someone’s daily story through pictures feels more real and meaningful than any narrative they might tell you when you ask the classic question: “How was your day?”
To keep your picture-snapping quick, and keep users in the moment, Days has implemented some restrictions.
One is that you must snap the pictures within the app, as you cannot import from the camera roll. The reason for this is that Days doesn’t want photoshopped, filtered, or edited photos on the service. They want you to feel like a photojournalist capturing each of the minute, but powerful, moments of your day.
Photos taken within Days are still saved to your camera roll, so you can share them through other social networks later if you feel the need.
Wander also picked up on the fact that users normally snap more than one picture of a certain event. This is to ensure you have multiple options for each instance.
But Wander doesn’t want you filling up your day with a bunch of throwaways and then having to go back and edit them out. So, to solve this problem, Wander turns all photos taken within ten seconds of each other into a gif. You have the option to go in and split the gif, delete one or two pics, or leave it the same.
Users can also add captions to all their photos after the fact, and go through and delete photos that they don’t want included in their Day. After that, you can share within the internal follow-model network, or push to your other social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.
But what about Wander?
Well, Wander is the umbrella brand behind a lot of lifestyle products the company is working on. Since Wander is focused on travel, and recording your experiences to be lived by others, Days has been released as a counterpart to that.
The app is available now in the App Store."	2013-05-03	811480	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-03-at-10-10-50-am.png?w=209	social/	Wander Launches Days App, Looks To Change Your Perspective Of Photo-Sharing Entirely		https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/03/wander-launches-days-app-looks-to-change-your-perspective-of-photo-sharing-entirely/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1734	Rip Empson	Apps	"With the proliferation of social networks today, we are by no means at a loss when it comes to connecting with our friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. However, in today’s highly networked world, we’re finding that there’s a lot of noise; it has become increasingly difficult to share stories, images, and links (or ask questions and seek assistance) from a targeted group of people. Those that can really help. A startup launching today at TechCrunch Disrupt, called LocalHero, has developed a mobile networking app that aims to help you make these targeted connections (and turn your friends into heroes).
But what does this mean IRL? Let’s say you’ve just joined a local softball league and you’re looking for a new mitt, but you don’t know what brand to buy or where you should go to shop. It just so happens that some of your friends are avid softballers, and you know that they would be the perfect group to ask for advice. LocalHero wants to be an easy way for you to connect with those people so that they can either lend you their mitt, or help you find the right place to go to buy one. 
How does LocalHero facilitate this? No, not by magic. The startup pulls information from your go-to social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google+, mixes that with location-enabled functionality, to create a data profile of your friends that are nearby and have the right skills (or interests) that would be relevant to your search.
While social networking apps have connected us in unthinkable ways, and we’re sharing our friends, our photos, and our location, there still aren’t many options for people looking to tap a specific group of friends without broadcasting to the entire network or creating specialized lists. LocalHero Co-founder and CEO Ana Baltodano said that she and her team want to create a smart way for friends to take action to become saviors to their friends in need. 

The co-founder said that LocalHero was created to be useful in a range of requests, from finding friends interested in joining a shared activity, to utilizing the knowledge of particular acquaintances to solve a problem, to more personal requests that you don’t want to share with strangers. In this sense, LocalHero is a bit Zaarly, a bit Katango, and a bit Yahoo Answers. Or a smart Craigslist for friends, if you will.
For LocalHero’s mobile app, users post requests for goods or requests, which users view in a stream that includes both general LocalHero users as well as one’s friends. Users can add photos and enrich the question, or request, with tags, and the app automatically notifies these people of your request — you can then scroll through the tags your friends and users have. 
From the tech side, the LocalHero team wanted to bring in the social graph and interest graph, and cross reference those against each other, pulling from a possible set of thousands of users to provide the user with just a few possible heroes (the “thousands” of users come from the entire LocalHero network, which currently stands at about 15,000). 
In terms of monetization, LocalHero is still considering different monetization strategies, with the leading contender being targeted local advertising both on the web and mobile app. The smart backend tech makes it easy to find local experts, but the startup also envisions commercial applications as well, and, specifically, LocalHero is in talks with both potential automotive and travel sites.

1773	Lucas Matney	Augmented Reality	"Twitter is beginning to devote resources toward building out a dedicated VR/AR-focused team. The social media company has hired former Apple designer Alessandro Sabatelli to lead the initiative as Twitter’s Director of VR and AR, Will Mason over at UploadVR reports.
Update: Twitter has confirmed the hire and said that the Augmented Reality team will be housed within the company’s machine learning arm, Twitter Cortex.
Sabatelli spent more than five years at Apple working on interface design for the company’s suite of mobile products. Since leaving Apple, Sabatelli became CEO of IXOMOXI, a VR-driven startup focused on building the “future of music experience.”
IXOMOXI put out a Gear VR app called Lucy earlier this year; it’s basically a series of trippy Snapchat-style filters that you can view through the VR headset using a phone’s passthrough camera. The company details that its app targets “millennials at music festivals.”
With initiatives like Moments, Twitter has continually reiterated its intent to capture the experience of the here-and-now. Unfortunately, they’ve missed the boat in a lot of ways when it comes to using this general philosophy to boost user-generated media content at events.
Snapchat, on the other hand, has done this very well and is really positioning itself as a significant power in the AR space through some intriguing acquisitions, including most recently Seene, a startup that lets users use their front-facing cameras to capture their face in 3D.
Whether Sabatelli will be helping Twitter play catch-up with Snapchat or will instead be pursuing new VR/AR ventures for the social media platform is up for debate, but it’s clear that with this hire Twitter is looking to flirt a bit more with the VR/AR medium."	2016-06-28	1344988	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/185862379.jpg?w=738	social/	Twitter is putting together a team focused on VR and AR	twitter	https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/28/twitter-is-putting-together-a-team-focused-on-vr-and-ar/	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1794	Drew Olanoff	Apps	"It’s a mix of Instagram and YouTube…maybe a bit of an old-school RockYou component. No matter how you look at it, Flipagram has seen enormous growth and is a mobile juggernaut.
Today, the company has formally announced that it has raised a $70 million B round of funding led by Sequoia and including Kleiner Perkins and Index Ventures. The company declined to talk valuation, but we reported last year that it was eyeing $300 million. Impressively, both Michael Moritz and John Doerr will be joining Flipagram’s board of directors. The last time that happened? A little company called Google.
A very youthful audience — think Snapchat — is putting together under-one-minute “Flipagrams” that can include photos, text, audio and music to the tune of over 14 million a month. Parse out the photos alone and users were sharing over 700 million photos a day in December 2014.
Something funny happened along the way, though.
As people added music to their creations, the company allowed its community to purchase music via iTunes links. It clearly worked out because the company is also announcing a deal with Universal Music Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music, Merlin and The Orchard, and music publishers, including Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group and BMG. This deal gives Flipagram the okay to allow its community to surf through a database of music clips to add to their storytelling.
What got Doerr interested in investing?
That’s press release speak for “Holy fuck, a lot of people are using this.” How many? The company tells me that they passed 30 million monthly active users at the end of 2014.
I’ve long wondered what people would do with the thousands of photos that they have on their camera roll and this appears to answer that question. Toss them together into a little musical video, I guess.
Once you make a Flipagram you can obviously get comments and likes from the community, but you can also ship the video out to different networks, music included. The No. 1 choice these days is Instagram, I’m told. It’s about bringing people into the app though, its CEO Farhad Mohit tells me. And for good reason; there’s money to be made.
Oh and brands on the platform? Check.
The app itself performs like you’d expect. You can flip through a stream of content, tapping something you want to see more of. You can jump to photos (backwards or forwards) if something catches your eye as the Flipagram plays.
The music tie-in is quite genius and gives Flipagram data that allows it to show a top list of musicians that are featured in Flipagrams. This is great as another entry point of discovery and of course a way to sell a few tracks. You’ve also got your artist pages in case the celebs want to join. So yeah, celeb stuff, check.

Artist of the month? Pitbull of course (to promote his next album, of course).
Personally, the flipping gives me a headache, but I’m old, I guess.
Some of these apps are hit or miss, but Flipagram clearly has staying power and has the celebrity and financing juice to succeed. I’ve watched it hover inside of the top 100 free apps overall on iTunes and it’s the top photo app on Google Play…so it’s got more than a shot.

Get to flippin’. Or something."	2015-07-15	1183529	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/hq.jpg?w=738	mobile/	Flipagram Raises $70M, Scores Record Label Deals Thanks To 30M+ Music Hungry Users		https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/15/flip-it-good/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1804	Mike Butcher	Apps	"Bizzabo, which provides a free self-service platform for event/conference organisers and a free app for attendees on iPhone and Android, has secured $1.5 million in funding to open a U.S. presence, hire and expand. Investors include Israeli figures such as Kaedan Capital Group; Gigi Levy; Prof. Yair Tauman; the AfterDox angels group and additional American and European angel investors. Pre-seed round investors (all Angels) also participated in the current round.
Founded in 2011 by Eran Ben Shushan, Alon Alroy and Boaz Katz, Bizzabo faces a crowded arena. There’s (deep breath) CrowdVine, Presdo, Oleapark, Shpare, Schmooze, Eventasaur, Omyconf, and to some extent Lanyrd in this space, as well as location-based networking apps like Highlig.ht, Sonar, Ban.jo and Intro. However, we’ve been impressed by Bizzabo’s interface and execution thus far. It’s also entirely free to organisers and attendees, and ticks a bunch of boxes for events.
Conferences that have used the app so far include the high-end MLOVE ConFestival in Berlin, VC conference NOAH, and in-house events by Qualcomm.
With Bizzabo, an event organiser can create an instant mobile social network for attendees prior to the event date. They enter the agenda and speaker profiles of their event and update information live, with the ability to push-notify changes to the event – a really important feature which conference organisers and attendees will find way more useful than the paper based schedules we all have to suffer with.
Attendees in turn only need one app which covers any event, rather than several apps for each event, and see which events are upcoming among friends.
The app cross-references your LinkedIn profile with other event attendees and identifies who will be the most beneficial contact for you. Attendees can message each other inside the app and it keeps a database of people you met at each event. Conference attendees can network on the app before the event but then check into the physical location of the conference, while event organisers can set a private code for people to use the app to prevent others from ‘virtually’ attending without paying for a ticket.
There’s also an “Offers” feature to allow exhibitors or sponsors to create Groupon type offers and generate business leads. We think this will be a very interesting model for the startup to pursue."	2012-07-31	619019	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-31-at-12-56-47.png?w=400	startups/	Bizzabo Secures $1.5 Million To Ramp Up Its Social Conference App		https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/bizzabo-secures-1-5-million-to-ramp-up-its-social-conference-app/	1	1	1	1	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
1809	Anthony Ha		"Meme-heavy image-sharing site Imgur says that it has now grown 100 million unique monthly visitors. The company also says it’s profitable, with paid Pro subscriptions and some promising-if-early results from big advertisers.
“More than a quarter” of its traffic is supposedly direct, so it’s not just depending on other sites that use its image hosting (such as online community Reddit) for its audience. Organic search traffic represents 5 percent. Other numbers that the company shared: It hosts 650 million images, with 1 million daily uploads. And mobile now accounts for 35 percent of traffic.
Imgur was founded in 2009, with recent product launches that include iOS and Android apps, as well as a new meme generator. Back in January, Imgur said it was generating 3.6 billion pageviews from 56 million unique monthly visitors.
Just for a point of comparison, I asked comScore for its traffic data, and the company reported that Imgur’s unique visitors in the United States have gone up from 8.7 million in August 2012 to 14.0 million in August 2013. That’s not really an apples-to-apples comparison, since the comScore data is US-only, so perhaps the more noteworthy point is comScore says Imgur’s US web traffic has grown 60 percent year-over-year.
As for advertising, which often takes the form of sponsored content tailored to the Imgur community, COO Matt Strader told me via email that advertisers include Paramount, GE, Virgin, and Sony Playstation. Strader described Imgur as “still very early and are experimenting” but already seeing results that “outperformed industry norms in every respect.”
Strader said he couldn’t get too specific, but he shared some of the results seen in a couple of those campaigns. For example, a sponsored content campaign tied to the release of the Grand Theft Auto V video game saw 7,000 social interactions (which include votes, comments, and shares), while campaigns for the TV show Psych have seen a 2.1 percent engagement rate.
“We want to keep a high bar for sponsored content because it will be featured alongside the other most popular image content on the web,” Strader said. “Our user community has an expectation of quality content so we want the sponsored content to stand up to that. Therefore, our focus is on partnering with brands that care about content and are looking for new marketing outlets to be creative.”"	2013-09-26	884045	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/rdu6zgv.png?w=400	startups/	Image-Sharing Site Imgur Says It Reaches 100M Unique Visitors Per Month		https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/26/imgur-100m/	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1828	Sarah Perez	Social	"Roamz, a startup which recently relaunched its mobile applications with a new focus on local search (as opposed to serendipitous discovery), is now bringing its local search engine to the web. Today, the company is debuting an online version of its service at Roamz.com, allowing users to view real-time content about nearby places and events, search for specific things, like coffee or shopping, and then drill down into each place to see more details and photos.
This is the same functionality as currently provided by Roamz’ mobile applications, available on Android and iPhone. You may remember that the company recently shifted away from its original idea of “serendipitous discovery” of local places and events when founder Jonathan Barouch realized that serendipity isn’t a use case. In a guest post for TechCrunch this July, he talked about how the company came to understand that “serendipity” alone was not enough of a motivation to open an app. The following month, Roamz relaunched with its new vision: instead of serendipity, it would now focus on directed, local search.
While users can still access various app features to enable serendipitous discovery of nearby activities, the app’s primary function is delivering local recommendations. As with the previous version, Roamz pulls its data from social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare and Instagram, but with the relaunch, it lets users query against that data more directly. For example, you could now type in “pizza” and a location, like a neighborhood within a larger city, or your own town. The results show you what people nearby you are saying about places that match your interests, and you can star your favorites for future reference.
Barouch declined to give numbers about app downloads since the relaunch, but says engagement is up following the addition of location-based alerts which tell users when they are near a trending event. For example, Roamz pinged anyone near Central Park when the pumpkin festival was seeing additional chatter on social media.
Online, the experience is nearly identical, save for the larger format. Although you can perform similar local searches on Foursquare.com (and Foursquare on mobile), the benefit of using Roamz is that you’re not just limited to Foursquare’s data. When testing the service to find frozen yogurt shops, for instance, I found photos and reviews from Foursquare, Facebook and Instagram filling my search results. These included interior shots of the stores, Instagram photos of the frozen treats, and even coupons and posts about store openings from Facebook.
To use the online service, head to Roamz.com, allow the browser to access your location and type in what you want to find.  The website uses the seemingly ubiquitous Pinterest-inspired pinboard user interface for search results, but when you click into a place page to view more details, the layout becomes one of a more traditional photo gallery and update stream, which will update with new posts in real-time.

1863	Sarah Perez	Apps	"Tiggly, an educational app designed for iPad’s youngest users – babies! (oh, and toddlers, too) – has raised a Series A round of funding led by Habermaass GmbH, a Germany-based early play and learning company, and owners of the toy brand HABA, which is now entering the U.S. edtech market. Though the startup won’t disclose the size of the round, it had previously raised $1 million in seed funding from May 2013 to January 2014, and the additional funding now brings its total raised to $5 million. So you can do the math.
As a parent myself, I know from personal experience the draw that mobile apps have for ever-younger users. Though I worked to limit technology’s use when my daughter was small (no baby chairs with iPad holders were in my home!), I did let her “fingerpaint” on iPad before she turned one, and introduced a small selection of educationally focused toddler apps as she grew older.
Tiggly was one of these.
The app is part of a $29.95 kit that includes four brightly colored geometric shapes (a square, circle, triangle, and star) which, when placed on the screen in position, transform into cute characters, like jungle animals, for example, or can be used in a variety of other games as stamps or drawing tools. The games are meant to encourage language development, creativity, spatial thinking and motor skills. They are like the iGeneration’s version of wooden blocks, perhaps.

Since launching in October 2013, Tiggly’s apps have been played over 400,000 times, and its “Tiggly Shapes” are now available in over 20 countries, across five continents and come in eight languages. The company says feedback has been positive so far, citing a 4.5 out of 5 rating on Amazon.com after 50 reviews. (The company declined to detail user numbers, sales or revenue.)
Explains founder Phyl Georgiou, Tiggly’s products are resonating with customers who are looking for “more wholesome” experiences on tablets for their children.
“This funding will help us expand our product line and provide more learning opportunities for preschoolers and kindergarteners who love apps,” he tells TechCrunch. “We decided to raise money from Habermaass because they have a 75-year track record of making learning toys that children cherish. Having a strategic partner like Habermaass will greatly enhance our distribution network and give us access to industry knowledge and contacts that will help us scale rapidly.”
Georgiou notes that the company had interest from traditional VCs, but chose Habermaas because of their experience in the toy and learning market. Habermaass GmbH, which makes €365 million annually, is based in Bad Rodach, Germany, and includes the brands HABA, Wehfritz and Jako-O. Its toys and games focus on high educational value and high quality design, but HABA brand is the most relevant to Tiggly, as it’s the toymaker for kids 0 to 6.
The additional capital will help the small startup grow its team from 6 to 12 people, expanding mainly its app and design team.
“In particular, we are investing heavily in building an engaging world where children can learn while having fun,” the founder says. The longer-term goal, he adds, is to offer educational products for those aged 18 months to six years old, including an expanded curriculum that covers other areas like numeracy and literacy.
“We believe there are a number of important early childhood development milestones that are best reached through the engaging gameplay we are pioneering, and this funding will help us fast track these products to the market,” says Georgiou."	2014-09-22	1061195	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/screen-shot-2014-09-22-at-3-19-00-pm.png?w=738	mobile/	Tiggly, An iPad Learning Toy For Babies And Toddlers, Raises Series A 		https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/22/tiggly-an-ipad-learning-toy-for-babies-and-toddlers-raises-series-a/	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
1866	Natasha Lomas	Apps	"Holiday attractions booking startup, GetYourGuide, which raised a $14 million Series A at the start of this year from Spark Capital and Highland Capital Partners Europe to internationalise its content and zero in on mobile, has made good on the latter portion of its plan — with the launch of its first mobile apps (available on iOS now, and landing on Google Play for Android users tomorrow).
“Our mobile traffic is growing at more than twice the rate than our web traffic is growing,” GYG CEO, Johannes Reck, tells TechCrunch. “We have the strong ambition to grow our mobile traffic to more than 50% of the total traffic in the next 12-18 months.”
The startup, which was founded back in 2009 as a student project, does not break out user numbers yet. But Reck confirms it’s continuing on a growth trajectory: “We are more than doubling revenue and traffic every year.”
GYG’s new apps pull in info on more than 23,000 tours & activities — such as museum visits, sightseeing trips & historical tours, mixed in with some more practical tourist requirements like airport transfers — from 2,200 global destinations, presenting them initially as a stack of thumbnails that can easily be thumbed through (offering more info as users drill down).
As well as repurposing its content for speedy mobile delivery, there’s the added mobile bonus of being able to detect the user’s location to make relevant suggestions. Users can browse activities for the current day, the next day or the weekend; read reviews and make bookings. Tours can be filtered by price, deals, duration, languages and more. The app creates a mobile voucher (such as the one below, right) for bookings, so there’s no need to print tickets. Payment is by credit card, with the option to save card details to speed up future bookings.

Back in January Reck told TechCrunch GetYourGuide was “going to bet the house on mobile”. Since then it has acquired deadpooled rival Gidsy — which had also been gearing up for a mobile push. GYG absorbed Gidsy’s team of 12, bolstering its apps push with relevant experience.
At the time of that acquisition, Edial Dekker, CEO and co-founder of Gidsy, told TechCrunch: “We’ve also been working a lot on mobile in the last months, but we did not launch it yet. We’ll have a huge opportunity to work on the same problems we tried solving in the first place: bringing people together around activities.”
Discussing the timing of its apps launch, Reck said previously, in the continental European markets where it is “particularly strong”, use of apps by travellers to get holiday suggestions has been retarded by factors such as mobile roaming charges. “With our increasing presence in the U.K. & U.S. and an exploding number of consumers taking the phone with them while traveling, now is the right time,” he tells TechCrunch.
“The European Commission announced that roaming will be significantly regulated within the next two years,” he adds. “We are seeing better price plans every year and the telecom operators are very interested in striking deals with travel companies to provide better consumer service. Again, I think the time has come for mobile travel applications to become mainstream. It makes so much sense.”
GetYourGuide’s app feels slick and relatively quick — with a cute bounding dog animation to keep you entertained while it harvests relevant tour data. However that content isn’t going to excite more discerning travellers, with a strong focus on more typical touristy fare.
For instance, when I queried the app for London attractions, it fired forth a barrage of tourist trap fodder, from Madame Tussauds to Hard Rock Cafe via a smorgasbord of Harry Potter tours. (And, bizarrely, several day trips to Stone Henge. Which isn’t exactly close to London — but is apparently a mainstream draw for U.K. visitors.)
This sort of content suggests GYG is gunning for the ‘road-well travelled’ tourist — which is, after all, likely the largest market. But that does mean it’s leaving room for alternative travel startups serving a more indie traveller category, such as U.S.-based AnyRoad.

1875	Drew Olanoff	Apps	"According to a report by Deadline, Snapchat is having massive second thoughts about producing its own content. A team of around 15 ran what was called the “Snapchat Channel,” which was going through a reimagining. That apparently led to not a relaunch, but a shutdown. The team has been let go.
How serious was Snapchat about creating its own content? It made a huge deal about a flashy hire, Marcus Wiley, just five months ago. Wiley was a senior vice president at Fox, working on the development of comedies like “New Girl,” “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” “The Mindy Project” and “Bob’s Burgers.” He’s now gone.
Here’s what a Snapchat spokesperson told us about Wiley:
Snapchat has around 100 million active users that apparently like to eat up content. In January, Snapchat launched “Discover,” which is a platform for content from partners like BuzzFeed, CNN and Yahoo. Companies that don’t mind paying for playing, apparently. But they’re not paying a ton. Snapchat must have thought it was best to leave it to the content people to create content, because none of its original stuff took off.
If the company changes its mind and one day wants to create again, it’s going to be really difficult to find talented people to bring onboard. When you announce big names and run them out of the company just months later, you’re not going to see truly creative folk chomping at the bit to “try again.”
P.S. While we’re talking about Snapchat, can someone explain this to me? Thanks."	2015-10-12	1222691	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/460110345.jpg?w=738	social/	Snapchat Gives Up On Original Content, Axes ‘Snapchat Channel’	snapchat	https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/ephemeral-ephemeral-ephemeral/	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1898	Mike Butcher	Europe	"It’s so simple and disruptive I wonder why others haven’t really tried it. Droplet is a mobile money app on iOS that lets you load cash onto your phone and send payments to anyone – including participating retailers – for free, via email. Unlike mobile payment companies like Square, iZettle and apps from the banks who own Visa and Mastercard, Droplet is about digitising cash, not putting credit cards on your phone or carrying around a plastic card reader. But crucially there are no charges to the individual or the merchant. The idea behind droplet is utterly simple, but very powerful.
In Kenya, M-Pesa processes more than a quarter of the country’s GDP via mobile phones because there’s virtually no banking system. Droplet could well do the same, if it plays its cards right, and create a viral adoption loop. All it would take would be for retailers – especially small ones – to start promoting it themselves.
Right now it only works with merchants in Birmingham, UK, but there are plans to roll it out more widely. You can try it out here and use it across various shops bars and restaurants in the city for now.
You and whoever you want to pay both have to have the app. But once you do, you can add cash to it via a debit or credit card (in multiples of £10) and pay anyone who both has the app and an email address which is associated with the app. You can also scan a special bar code with your phone when you reach the till of a retailer. Cleverly, the app itself shows nearby merchants based on your location, making it even easier to find the merchant you want to pay, assuming you are in the shop at the time. It also gives you the ability to add notes and search your transaction history – this could be very powerful. It’s not unlike Venmo which was acquired this year.
In theory you could use it for any currency, though right now it would be converted into Pounds Sterling.
Droplet is highly disruptive because the startup has decided not to charge anything to add money to your account, and it is also free for merchants. Merchants love it because it’s a way of avoiding bank charges and the extras that iZettle and others would charge.
The startup could well light the touch paper on something. It costs almost nothing to move information around the web, so why does the banking and payments industry still charge users to move their own money around? Exactly.
Co-founders Will Grant and Steffan Aquarone set out to create such an app after sitting in a coffee shop.
“We were sat in Urban Coffee Company in Birmingham and thought about all the things that hadn’t yet been transformed by the web. It was quite clear the banking and payments industry was ripe for disruption and the customer experience could be rebooted and simplified,” says Aquarone
The nine-strong team has put the app into beat for the last six weeks and has revealed its numbers from the trial to TechCrunch for the first time:
• 50+ merchants in Birmingham City Centre and counting
• 1,000+ users and growing
• Average top up value £17.89 and increasing
• Average payment value £10.68 and increasing
Here are some stats:
The security is, they claim, military-grade, and they spent a year prior to the beta launch ensuring the platform was extremely secure. “We’ve got all the security measures in place that you would expect from a global online bank. What’s more, we don’t store any sensitive information on people’s phone; it’s all on our secure servers, which use SSL/TLS encryption. There is no permanent connection to bank accounts either, making it even safer,” says Aquarone. Amongst the team is the former brand director for Visa Europe.
How will they make money? When people top up their accounts, Droplet holds their funds in trust. This means they can take their money back out of the Droplet economy at any time. But Droplet makes a very small amount of money in interest from these deposited funds, which covers the cost of the system. So far they’ve seen a very encouraging ‘dwell time,’ where instead of taking their money back out, people are leaving it in their Droplet accounts and sending it to other people – they are even starting to see the first B2B payments using Droplet.
Droplet also has backing from the E4F Accelerator on Birmingham Science Park.
Now, admittedly there is the threat of money laundering; however Aquarone says they have built a number of machine-learning tools into the system to detect odd behaviour like that.
But technically there is nothing to stop Droplet spreading virally if retailers and merchants decide they want to promote the app. Certainly, in these straightened economic times, you can see many hard-pressed small retailers jumping on something that avoids multiple bank charges.

1913	Kim-Mai Cutler	Apps	"You may remember the name Blippy from such startups as the one that shared your credit card purchases with friends.
The concept died. But the name lived on.
Another team of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs bought the domain for Blippy, and they’re using it for a new app that makes it dead simple to find and make animated GIFs. Because we all wish we could find that perfect facepalm or dog GIF to strike the right note.
Co-founder David King, who previously built up a social gaming company Green Patch and sold it to Playdom (which was then sold to Disney), said the app taps into an emerging trend of visual communication.
Not only are we seeing stickers take off in apps like Line, Facebook Messenger and Path, ephemeral messaging app Snapchat is also about very fast, visual communication. Anxious bears, woeful bunnies and typing cats capture feelings words can’t quite match.
But one obvious and missing link seems to be in animated GIFs. They run wild through platforms like Tumblr and our internal TechCrunch newsfeed, but there hasn’t really been a breakout mobile app for animated GIFs. Basically, it’s just technically difficult to make a messaging app with working animated GIFs outside of products like iMessage. There are issues with speed, or problems with creating an effective GIF search without proper tags or keywords.
The new incarnation of Blippy is starting from a pretty basic place. It’s not a full-on chat service. It instead just makes it easy to find the right GIF to share through iMessage, Facebook, Twitter or Tumblr.
“We want to be just focused on finding and curating great GIFs,” King said.
There are categories for pets, celebrities, sports, #fail and so on. Then there’s a basic search engine that you can swipe down from above.
Once you pick one, you can overlay a personal message in any number of absurd or “elegant” fonts and colors.

Then you just zip it off to iMessage or any other of the big platforms. One feature not available now is the ability to create animated GIFs from your phone’s video or photo library. But it’s one that may come shortly."	2013-11-14	914857	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blippy-choose.png?w=322	mobile/	Blippy Is Reborn As A Dead Simple Mobile App For Finding Ridiculous Gifs		https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/14/blippy-2/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4

Miao Pai, which lets users shoot, edit, and share 10 second videos, launched in late 2013 with help from Sina Weibo (the company spun off its microblogging service as Weibo before filing for an initial public offering in 2014). Before Tencent’s messaging app WeChat took off, Weibo was China’s dominant social media platform, and it is still one of the biggest and most influential, with 222 million monthly active users.
Weibo plans to partner with Yixia Tech on two new projects. The first is a new video product that will launch soon and the second is a $100 million fund for Miao Pai video contributors that will focus on traffic growth, co-branding, and advertising revenue share.

1959	Sarah Perez	Startups	"One year after the infamous Fab.com “reset” from a social network for gay men to a powerhouse design shopping site, CEO Jason Goldberg is taking a look back on the company’s progress. Staying true to the startup’s “one thing” as he calls it (design, obviously), the company has grown to more than 2.5 million members, up from 1.5 million at the end of last year. That’s 67 percent growth in the first two months of 2012, Goldberg notes.
And last month was Fab’s best yet, beating out both the holiday sales of December and the pre-holiday rush which contributed to November’s record-breaking month.
While Fab doesn’t break out exact sales figures for these time frames, the company tells us they’re now on their way toward $100 million in revenue this year, to give you an idea.

Fab is seeing some decent engagement among its users, too. 25,000 customers have made five or more purchases on the site, and repeat customers account for two-thirds of the company’s business.
Facebook referrals are helping to drive some of that business – Fab says that its social shopping integrations now account for 15 percent of its daily traffic, and Facebook visits have doubled since December.
But perhaps more important than social, is mobile. Today, more than 40 percent of Fab’s usage comes from its mobile apps, launched in October. And here’s something else: mobile shoppers purchase more often and with bigger basket sizes than Fab’s web shoppers do. Why is that? Maybe because Fab’s mobile applications are always on hand, and notify you when those addictive, time-sensitive flash sales are about to start? The notifications draw you into the app with a sense of urgency that feels (at least in this shopper’s opinion), more enticing than when browsing Fab on the desktop.
Then there’s the latest feature to hit Fab.com: the weekly shops, which went live in January before arriving on mobile in February. These shops allow customers to browse storefronts which are organized around product categories, as opposed to by designers. Already, the shops’ impact is being felt, as they contributed more than 10 percent of Fab’s sales in February.
For the company, this sales growth has led to growth of the Fab team itself. This time last year, Fab had four full-time employees in New York. Today, it has over 200 people working in N.Y., Berlin, Pune and Deinze.
Fab.com’s pivot reset, is one of those success stories other startups hope to learn from. So what’s the secret? That goes back to that “one thing” Goldberg referred to.
The team scrapped its 150K-member social network so it could focus on the intersection of these three things: what they were most passionate about, what they believed they could realistically be the best in the world at, and what they were certain they could develop into a big business in a market ripe for destruction. At the end of the day (or rather, the night…and the wine), they realized their “one thing” is design.
It sounds like such a simple formula, but finding that thing – and then executing well on it – is something that’s easier said than done.
As for what’s next for Fab? Golberg says the company has “Amazon-scale plans”:
“We’re building a business for the decades,” he says. “This is just one year into working on it and nine months into operating it.”"	2012-03-01	511472	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/fab-napkin.jpg?w=400	startups/	One Year Post-Pivot, Fab.com Is On Track To $100M In Revenue In 2012		https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/01/one-year-post-pivot-fab-com-is-on-track-to-100m-in-revenue-in-2012/	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1964	Sarah Perez	Fundings & Exits	"Would you install an Android app that put ads directly on your smartphone’s lock screen? No? What if you were paid to do so, and whenever you swiped to unlock your device, you made a little money? That’s the promise of a new mobile application called Locket, launching today for Android, backed by $500,000 in funding from Great Oaks VC and a couple of undisclosed angel investors from the entertainment and marketing industries.
The New York-based startup was founded in March by Yunha Kim, Paul Jang, and Christopher Crawford, and is currently working out of a Manhattan apartment where five founding team members live and work alongside their three dogs and a hamster.
Kim tells TechCrunch that the startup closed on the Great Oaks funding just three days after its pitch – their first VC pitch ever, she notes.
Before building Locket, Kim graduated magna cum laude from Duke University and worked as an investment banking analyst at Jefferies.
“Working in banking, my only outlet to my outside life was my phone,” she says. “And looking at my lock screen – which was just a picture of a daisy – the question was, ‘how do we monetize that?'” The idea inspired her to team up with fellow Duke grad Jang and Crawford, whose background is in advertising.
The company thinks there’s room to define a new market for mobile advertising, which they’re calling “first glance” ads. The idea is already taking off in some overseas markets like Korea, where similar businesses have achieved over 20 percent of Android market share penetration in three months after their debut, Kim explains. However, in the U.S., where Locket is currently focused, it’s basically untapped.
The experience of Locket is not all that different from those lock screen ads on some Kindle devices. But instead of forcing users to view the ads, like the ad-supported Kindles do, users have the choice to engage or not. They can choose to engage by swiping in one direction to be directed to a website, Facebook Page, coupon voucher, or movie trailer, for example, or they can go directly to their homescreen by swiping the other way. Regardless of whether they “click-through,” users are paid 1 cent per swipe, capped at 3 cents per hour for now.
Ads will also be targeted using social profile data from Facebook (or a brief questionnaire), geolocation, other app usage, and engagement history.
At launch, Locket has a limited selection of about eight advertisers on board, and will also be running house ads to fill the space. However, Kim says that in around a month, they plan to offer ads from more than ten advertisers. The company also has deals in the works with two larger Fortune 500 companies, but she’s not allowed yet to disclose them by name.
Not all advertisers will be accepted, as Locket’s goal is to respect the very personal landscape that is the mobile phone lock screen. The startup has already rejected ads from alcohol and lingerie brands, for instance, as well as one for a mobile app that wasn’t well-designed.
After an advertiser is approved, the turnaround time to get their creative onto users’ phones is about two weeks. Locket also has an in-house creative team, and a technical crew that tests ads on 20 top Android smartphones they keep in the office (um, apartment). They do try to achieve compatibility with most leading Android phones, but the market today includes some 1,600 devices, so the long tail may still experience issues during Locket’s beta, which begins now. The company claims they’ve also worked hard to limit the impact on battery usage.
Advertiser costs vary, but the goal is to push Locket over $10 CPM, eventually hoping to top Flipboard’s $30 CPM for its in-app, full-screen ads, says Kim. “We want to be able to charge more than that because we’re front of your mind, right in front of your face. Whatever you’re doing, you’ll see the ad on the lock screen.”
Will Consumers Bite?
Locket’s launch comes at a time when Facebook’s move to take over users’ Android lock screens – and devices – has been met with some resistance. Facebook’s Android launcher Home has not yet been the success the social network hoped for, but there are parts of the experience users liked. One of those parts is the “Cover Feed” which brings images and status updates to the Android lock screen. What made users uncomfortable, however, was news that Home would one day include ads on this screen, as well. Users didn’t like the idea of having ads forced upon them, but Locket works around that psychological hurdle by offering to pay users for their time.
One cent per swipe, and no more than 3 cents per hour (at least, for now), is not much money, of course. But given how much users interact with their phones it’s easy money that could add up over time. Maybe you won’t make but a few dollars per month at first, but as more advertisers come on board, that could change. If anything, the couponing craze and success of rewards sites like Swagbucks demonstrate there’s at least a portion of the market that will work hard for little reward. Locket, meanwhile, requires very little user effort.
“What we’re trying to do is change the perception people have towards ads. On mobile, ads suck right now,” says Kim. “But our ads are different because they’re beautiful and they actually reward you for your glances. We hope users will like it.”
Locket is a free download on Google Play here."	2013-07-18	847872	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/locket-screen-2.png?w=400	startups/	Locket Puts Ads On Smartphone Lock Screens, Pays You To Use Your Phone		https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/18/locket-puts-ads-on-smartphone-lock-screens-pays-you-to-use-your-phone/	1	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
1967	Steve O'Hear	Europe	"Tink, a personal finance mobile app that is popular in Sweden, has closed a $4 million Series A round led by Sunstone Capital, with participation from financial entrepreneur Sven Hagströmer and existing investors. The fresh capital will be used by Tink to expand internationally, including further developing the product and increasing head-count. The startup previously raised a $800,000 seed round in early 2013.
Launched in September in Sweden last year, and available for iOS and Android, Tink’s mobile app lets you keep a handle on your personal finances, by linking the app to banks accounts and credit cards. Targeting the young and mobile, specifically, it presents insights into spending habits via a news-feed style stream in a bid to make it, well, fun, as well as productive.
“Personal finance is generally something that people find boring, time consuming and stressful,” Tink co-founder and CEO, Daniel Kjellen, tells TechCrunch. “We remove the hassle from managing your personal finances and make it smart, fun and actionable to keep track. The user connects their bank accounts and credit cards to Tink and we continuously collect, sort and analyse everything about the user’s personal finances.”
In addition, Tink enables the you to set budgets and get “insights and fun facts” about your personal finances. “We have seen that this is very attractive for the young and mobile user who normally would not spend time on tracking their money,” adds Kjellen.
To that end, Tink claims over 200,000 users of the app — more than 2 percent of Sweden’s entire population have an account, apparently — and says in particular it is resonating with females in their early 20s. Competition-wise, the U.S. has a number of similar apps, as does a number of countries in Europe, but Kjellen thinks Tink’s feed-based UI, designed to be extremely time-efficient and let you dip in and out of the app, gives it the upper hand.
“In the US there are obviously products such as Mint and Level Money. In Europe we see the companies such as Numbrs (DE), Bankin’ (FR) and Money Dashboard (UK) offering more or less similar services to Tink. We believe we have a strong advantage by creating a fully automated mobile product where everything is presented in a feed format which makes it useful even if you have only have 2 minutes to spare,” he says.
Meanwhile, Sunstone’s Christian Jepsen echoes those sentiments when I ask him why he chose to invest in Tink. “Simplifying finance is never easy but this team does a fantastic job at it — and the users show their appreciation by recommending Tink to their friends and returning as loyal users,” he says. “While the U.S. market has seen a number of companies offering compelling apps in this area, the EU has seen very little innovation in this space. Sunstone invested in Tink because we believe they can achieve that.”"	2014-09-12	1055214	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tink.png?w=738	startups/	European Personal Finance App Tink Raises $4 Million Series A		https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/12/tink/	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
2013	Anthony Ha	Apps	"Cleverbug, a smartphone app that uses social network data to improve printed birthday cards, first launched in mid-January. The company tells me that as of early February, the app was downloaded 25,000 times by users in 89 countries, with 2.5 million birthdays now in the system.
The app integrates with your Facebook account, so it can remind you when people’s Facebook friends’ birthdays are coming up. Then it’s easy to create a personalized card — Cleverbug recommends different designs and Facebook photos that you can include, and you add or edit the text as well. Then you can print and send a card from more than 70 partner locations around the world for $2.99 plus postage.
The result is a card should feel much less boring and generic than something purchased in a store (to say nothing of the generic “Happy birthday!” messages posted on Facebook Walls), while still being quite convenient for the sender. Cleverbug can also time a Facebook post with a virtual version of the card, so all your friends can appreciate the card, too (and Cleverbug gets a little viral promotion).
I asked founder and CEO Kealan Lennon whether he’s considered offering a digital-only product (I’ve heard that many Zazzle users, for example, like to design and share virtual versions of personalized items without actually buying the physical good). He said it’s a possibility, but he also pointed out that there’s something special about print, and maybe that’s even more true when more and more of our photos move online.

2090	MG Siegler	Gaming	"A few weeks ago, we wrote about Life Is Crime, a new location-based mobile game. The premise is pretty awesome: it’s like Foursquare meets Grand Theft Auto. You go around (virtually) beating up friends for money. As it happens, the game has helped parent company Red Robot Labs score some loot of their own — an $8.5 million Series A.
Benchmark Capital is leading the round with current investors Shasta Ventures, Rick Thompson (co-founder of Playdom), and Chamath Palihapitiya (former Facebook exec) participating as well. Benchmark’s Mitch Lasky will be joining the board as a result.
Red Robot Labs launched Life Is Crime at Penny Arcade Expo (PAX) in Seattle and they note that the convention center where the show was held saw some 20,000 virtual crimes committed in the game during that weekend alone. That resulted in thousands of hurt criminals, millions in contraband trafficked, and tens of millions of dollars robbed or laundered. They tout these things in their press release, which is awesome. Clearly the game caught on quickly with its core demographic.
And all of that is just on Android. The iPhone version isn’t ready quite yet but should be out soon. And I can’t wait for that, so I too can get out there and kick some virtual ass.
The funding won’t go just towards this one game though, Red Robot Labs is also building out a whole location-based gaming platform. They hope to have three games done by the end of the year — and one of those will be built by a third-party.

2124	Kim-Mai Cutler	Apps	"Andreessen Horowitz revealed that it made $78 million off its $250,000 seed investment in Instagram’s billion-dollar acquisition in a post that was meant to quell criticism that it “fumbled” its involvement with the company.
“Ordinarily, when someone criticizes me for only making 312 times my money, I let the logic of their statement speak for itself,” wrote general partner Ben Horowitz. “However, in this case, the narrative that some critics put forth has the nasty side effect of casting two outstanding entrepreneurs—Kevin and Dalton Caldwell—in an unfair light and glosses over an important ethical issue that we faced.”
While Andreessen Horowitz was one of Instagram’s very earlier investors, it said it didn’t follow-on because of a conflict of interest with another company it funded. The firm had supported Picplz, another photo-sharing concept that didn’t end up having as much momentum as Instagram. The company behind it eventually changed changed course and turned into App.net, which gives other mobile developers landing pages and other tools for acquiring users.
Dalton Caldwell, who was chief executive of the company behind Picplz, was already working on photo concepts in April 2010, a month after Kevin Systrom raised $500,000 in funding for Burbn, a location-sharing concept that would eventually morph into Instagram. Instagram launched in early October 2010 and Caldwell’s company said it had closed funding in early November. Instagram later went on to take funding in a round led by a rival top-tier firm, Benchmark Capital.
Last week, The New York Times ran a story saying that Andreessen Horowitz had basically screwed up its investment in the company. The decision to fund Picplz “was a calculated bet against Instagram and it left Mr. Systrom livid,” the Times reported.
But Horowitz is framing the choice as an ethical issue:
And note to future founders: Horowitz emphasized that what Instagram did in selling to Facebook for $1 billion is exceedingly rare. For every company like that, there are literally thousands of failures. 
He added, “News to world: it generally takes longer than two years to create a billion dollars in value. What Kevin and team did was special and unique.”

2232	Sarah Perez	Apps	"New York and Seattle-based Viewfinder is officially debuting a mobile application which aims to serve as something between a photo organization utility and private social network. Built by a team of ex-Googlers and others, the app offers a way for users to start private chats, quickly share their photos with friends who can then comment on the items, un-share photos as needed, as well as efficiently search back through their photo history.
Of course, the market for photo-sharing apps is overly crowded at this point, but Viewfinder is aiming to define its niche by not squarely fitting into just one category. It’s not just for photo sharing, not just a utility, and not just a social network.
If anything, the app shares is most similar to mobile messaging apps, given Viewfinder’s focus on real-time conversations, which tend to be centered around photos.
“I don’t think of this app as being about photo sharing. I think that’s one of its constituent parts” explains co-founder Spencer Kimball, who previously spent a decade at Google, most recently working on Google’s exascale distributed file system. “What we’ve tried to develop is something that’s a lot deeper – we want to create spaces for your memories to live.”
Kimball describes these spaces as organic social networks – ranging from those that crop up between a larger group of people attending an event, to smaller networks, such as those between you and your significant other.
However, although the focus is on preserving these memories, Viewfinder does include a feature which aims to address the accidental over-share: it actually lets you un-share photos. Unlike Snapchat where photos quickly disappear, Viewfinder allows users to “un-share” photos within seven days of adding them. There are no mechanisms to prevent downloads, or alerts when photos are being downloaded, so there’s less of a feeling of absolute privacy when on Viewfinder, though.
While it’s easy enough to question whether or not users need yet another mobile social app, photo-sharing or otherwise, Viewfinder does have some interesting features within its design.
For example, when you want to search back through your past photos, you can press alongside the right of the screen to reveal a “jump scroll” interface (see screenshots and video below). The design of this scroll wheel is not something I’ve seen in other apps before. Here, it breaks up photo archives by year, month and location – helpful when you’re searching for a set of specific images. And the interface is smart, too. As you expand and contract the timeline by swiping your finger over it, it can filter out the photo groupings which are less important.
“It makes that determination based on how much you’ve shared with people, and how unusual the place is,” says Kimball. If you don’t visit a particular city often, for instance, it would know that’s likely a notable grouping of photos.
Within these organic social networks, users can star photos to save them within their own chronologically-based photo libraries, export photos to their camera roll, and invite other, non-iPhone users to join in via a web-based interface. Meanwhile, the app’s “inbox” keeps you posted on new additions to any group message, no matter how old.
Going forward, the team plans to add Android support, and will begin integrating with other third-party services in order to provide even more contextual info to the photo groups. Kimball didn’t want to go into much detail on this latter addition, but explained that the bigger idea is that users would never have to tag a photo again or organize photos into folders, if using Viewfinder.
The company is currently monetizing by offering a paid version of the service where users can host the full-resolution version of photos $1.99 per month, or upgraded storage for $9.99/month. These prices may change in time.
Kimball is joined by co-founders Brian McGinnis (CEO), formerly of Lehman Brothers; Peter Mattis, who also previously worked on Google’s exascale file system as well as Google Goggles; and professional photographer Chris Schoenbohm. The team is headquartered in New York and has an undisclosed seed round of funding from private investors, which is north of $1 million.

2235	Eric Eldon	Mobile	"Startups like Viddy and Socialcam are angling to be the Instagram of video — that is, to figure out some simple way of creating, editing and sharing mobile videos, in a way that resonates with users like the photo-sharing service has.
But it’s hard, Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom said on stage at Le Web London today, because of the medium. Videos take minutes to load. “Users want a faster experience, they want to produce quickly. [With Instagram] you can take a photo and make it beautiful in seconds.”
After some prodding from host Loic Le Meur, he conceded that there are some “really interesting things going on” in video. But he didn’t cite the startups I mentioned. Instead, he talked about Cinemagram, a mobile app that lets you animate photos, GIF-style. Maybe some new feature like that are coming for the startup that Facebook bought? He said last year that video-ish updates could be coming.
(By the way, about that sale price. I’ve recently heard that the company sold for meaningfully more than the $1 billion that we and others previously heard, albeit for a mix of cash and stock. So, the amount will change along with Facebook’s day-to-day stock price.)
Systrom, whose social filtered-photo app now has “more than 50 million users,” also had some advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. “Too many people are focused on the late nights, the fun things, all the meta stuff that doesn’t matter. It’s a means to an end. Instead, they should focus on big problems.”
The talk didn’t directly address how Instagram itself solves a big problem — in fact, a common pundit gripe is that it shouldn’t be worth $1 billion because it doesn’t. But Systrom, Le Meur, and chef-celebrity Jamie Oliver talked about what Instagram does do, which is make humans around the world more connected and aware of each other.

2306	Darrell Etherington	Apps	"The live streaming app battle may not have much room for many offerings besides early mover Meerkat and Twitter-owned Periscope, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t going to try. There’s still some hype left in the bottom of that particular barrel, and Yeplive is hoping to scoop it up by offering some features notably omitted from any of the other current offerings.
Yeplive is a Canadian startup that offers live broadcasts via mobile devices, with apps for iOS and Google Play, with a few differences including location-centric feeds, with maps and pins to show where broadcasts are originating, as well as a full-featured conversation interface available on the web so that anyone can join in the conversation.
Yeplive has GPS verification, meaning you can reliably trust that broadcasts are actually coming from where they claim to be coming from, but that also means it’s an app that’s not designed for users super-focused on geo privacy. The app is leaning on location as one of its differentiating factors, however, so it’s not looking to be everything to everyone.
It also archives content by default, which another one of those features that either aren’t offered by, or are in some ways limited by both of the major competitors in this field. Another big unique feature is landscape filming, which will satisfy video quality fanatics out there who vocally oppose the portrait-only orientation of both Meerkat and Periscope – but this may just be a “get off my lawn” situation, since other platforms popular with the youths like Snapchat also seem to favor the vertical.
The live chat function is perhaps the most interesting so far, since it doesn’t even require that the audience have an app installed, and it means that Yeplive’s can have equal impact across various social platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Google+ (there’s even Instagram support coming soon, albeit for archived feeds).
After a lot of initial buzz, both Periscope and Meerkat have mostly receded peacefully into the collective social background consciousness, but long-term the market still probably has potential. Is crossing feature requests for competitors off a list enough to build a viable alternative to the current leaders? Not necessarily, but some different thinking in the space can only help it progress overall."	2015-06-24	1175468	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/yeplivee284a2-livestreaming-video-app-available-for-ios-android-and-online.png?w=738	mobile/	Yeplive Brings Landscape Video And Web Comments To The Live Streaming Fight		https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/24/yeplive/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2366	Darrell Etherington	Apps	"London-based startup and Netflix for small children Hopster is on the verge of launching its unlimited TV content app, the company announced today, with a UK iOS App Store debut planned for November. The app will provide subscription-based all-you-can-watch access to shows aimed specifically at the 2 to 6 set, spanning 800 titles and including some of the most iconic kids characters ever created.
Hopster is announcing its partner arrangements ahead of the launch, which include deals with Nelvana, DHX Media and Millimages. These partnerships bring streaming video on demand rights to Hopster for a number of popular preschooler titles, including Babar, Max & Ruby, SuperWhy, Madeline, Paddington Bear and 64 Zoo Lane. That’s just the start, according to Hopster, which will reveal additional content over the course of the next few months.
While Hopster has a Netflix-like content distribution and access model, it also incorporates a key educational platform angle that sets it apart from other online streaming video services. That’s what makes Hopster more than just a competitor for a subsection of Netflix’s or LOVEfilm’s  larger library; it incorporates interactive learning games which are tailored to a child’s viewing habits and history. Those games and activities comprise a curriculum that Hopster says develops along with the child, which has been created in line with guidelines set out by the UK Early Years Foundation and built by educators.
“We believe that kids and families are different so there is a need for services, like Hopster, that are designed just for kids,” Hopster CEO Nick Walters explained via email. “For example, Hopster has defined a user experience just for preschool kids – easy to navigate, very little text, full of surprising and delightful activity. We also make really smart use of interactive games through a ‘two screens in one’ experience, making it stimulating and active like no other TV service does.”
All Hopster activity is also funnelled into “smart reports” that are made available to parents of children using the app, though the app itself is designed to be able to be used by a child completely independent of any adult. It’s a completely ad-free service, and the only payment throughout the app is the one for the recurring subscription, which means kids can’t accidentally rack up in-app purchase charges.
Hopster’s founding team includes Walters, a former Nickelodeon executive, as well as Sander Striker of Vdio and Joost, Mahesh Ramachandra off Galleon Entertainment and Bradley Archer, also ex-Nickelodeon. The team has ample experience with kids content and with streaming media services, and is backed by an advisory board which has experience in kids educational publishing and preschooler content.
The entire concept of Hopster is based on the realization that kids are inevitably drawn to the digital devices in or lives, and that they’re also very much interested in streaming content. Walters and his team wanted to find a way to scratch that itch for kids with a guilt-free solution that would also provide useful, genuine education value instead of just mindless (or haphazardly educational) entertainment.
Drawing audiences away from kid-friendly sections of prevailing streaming giants like Netflix will be tough, since parents get something additional out of that subscription, too, but there might just be room for a solution aimed specifically at the preschool educational vertical, and Hopster definitely has the right content to see if there is."	2013-09-26	883984	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/hopster-tv.jpg?w=400	europe/	Hopster, The Netflix For Pre-Schoolers, Hits UK App Store In November With Babar, Madeline, SuperWhy And More		https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/26/hopster-the-netflix-for-pre-schoolers-hits-uk-app-store-in-november-with-babar-madeline-superwhy-and-more/	1	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
2374	Sarah Perez	Social	"As e-book publishers and Apple face an antitrust lawsuit over pricing, magazine publishers are now looking into an alternative solution to the digital pricing dilemma: being able to extricate themselves from Apple’s grip entirely. A startup called Netizine, makers of a new, tablet-ready social magazine platform for publishers is currently in talks with seven of the ten top global publishers, we’re told, including three of the top five in the U.S.
And what is Netizine offering? Only a fully functional, HTML5-based tablet application that turns digital magazines into social networks…networks that run outside the App Store, that is.
Magazine publishers’ efforts, to date, have been a mixed bag. Some are OK, while others have been pretty awful,  basically turning their content into slow and heavy apps that take up more than their fair share of the iPad’s disk space. Their early failure on this front has left room for startups like Flipboard and Zite to innovate and build new ways to consume news in a “magazine-like” interface.
Enter Netizine.
The company, now in closed beta with an early launch scheduled for summer 2012, is an entirely new take on how magazines can operate in the new digital, tablet-focused computing age. And it’s all about social.
Netizine CEO Jonathan Harris, a self-described “print guy,” the former GM of a large publishing business (Africa’s Media24), explains that today’s “social magazine apps” are not really social.
“I’m a big consumer of Flipboard, but I do not define that as a social magazine.” he says. “The reason it’s labeled a ‘social magazine’ is because when it started, it aggregated my social feeds and turned that into a magazine experience.”
“But social is broadly limited [in Flipboard] to a page-to-many experience – i.e. share the page, tweet the page – which is pretty much a commodity these days, and a fairly standard experience across the board.”
With Netizine, however, publishers have the tools to build an entire social network within their magazine, in order to allow readers to socialize around content. It’s a more in-depth an experience that something like the community solutions designed for websites – like Disqus, Badgeville, or Livefyre, for example, which are mainly focused on commenting, user profiles, and reputation management.
Netizine builds an entire network, with a robust feature set that includes not just profiles and commenting, but also tools to share, bookmark, favorite, and rate articles, plus live chat, one-to-one instant messaging, groups (similar to LinkedIn), both the ability to friend other readers as well as the ability to follow them (one-way friendships), support for check-ins (!), integrations of the publishers’ and advertisers’ social presences from Facebook and Twitter, support for reader blogs, and more.
Publishers can pick and choose which of the tools they want included, of course, and they’re all customizable. And while for readers, the additions may just be seen as fun new ways to interact, for publishers, it’s all about building up the demographic profiles of their audience, which can then be sold to advertisers. (Sound familiar?)

One example of how this would work: magazine ads may show readers a “check-in” option (with optional sync to Foursquare) in exchange for some sort of deal, discount or coupon. Readers, wanting the deal, then do so, providing the publisher with details as to where they are located and what they were reading at the time.
The numerous social features aren’t provided solely to allow readers a new way to socialize around the magazine’s content or for better analytics, though – they also make it possible for the magazines to introduce new ways to navigate through content.
Instead of trying to reproduce the print magazine in digital format, with Netizine, the solution is to use social metrics as a way to present a magazine’s articles. For example, readers can dive into the “most commented,” section first, or the “most bookmarked,” “most shared,” or “highest rated.”
But the entry of Netizine raises the question: what of Next Issue Media, the magazine industry’s joint venture to build a “Hulu for magazines,” (involving Conde Nast, Hearst, Meredith, News Corp., and Time Inc.)? Some of those players are also looking at Netizine, it seems.
Explains Harris, “these guys are cognizant of what happened to the music industry, which is the creation of the dominant intermediary – more money being in music today, but not the music companies making it – so what they’re doing is toeing the water,” he says.  “[Next Issue] is a really good first attempt…I think they’re experimenting. And for us, it’s the best news we could ever hear of, because it gives us channel we didn’t have a couple of weeks ago.”
The new platform, which is built with HTML5 and CSS3 for responsive design (meaning screen size doesn’t matter), can be used in two ways by publishers. For those behind on the HTML5 “trend” (sadly, that’s many), Netizine can convert their PDFs to HTML5 for them, wrap the social layer around the content, and return to them, in a couple of hours, their brand wrapped in social. Alternately, publishers can choose to take their own HTML pages and use Netizine as more of a white label service. Regardless of which option they take, however, Netizine hosts the content, giving the publisher a URL.
Netizine plans to take its cut off as a “small percentage” off the magazine’s app’s subscription price, which, not surprisingly, will be lower than Apple’s.
It remains to be seen which publishers end up launching on Netizine later this summer, of course. But Harris says he believes this is the future. “Our bet is that the social magazine space is the next big space, and the native, enriched app was a stepping stone.”
In other words, it’s a big bet that magazine publishers will pull out of the iTunes App Store, and move to the web instead, lest they risk splitting their audience into the countable, social group and the native-based, less social demographic. While publishers may be willing to take this shot, whether users will follow them – especially when there are other great apps for browsing news and features (like Flipboard!) – definitely remains to be seen.
Netizine is currently self-funded. Interested parties can sign up here.

2412	Eric Eldon	Apps	"Some of us can’t be bothered to check in, but still want to find interesting people nearby. The challenge for developers is how to do this in a way that is both useful and not creepy. Glancee, available for both iOS and Android, gets closer to solving these problems than most I’ve seen.
The app lets you sign in with Facebook, then it shows you people within 100 yards, or one, two, or ten miles who have things in common. In some ways this sounds similar another app I recently covered, Highlight — but there are key differences, that will make each app appeal to different sets of users.
Glancee works extra hard to match interests while minimizing the stalker feel. The main screen shows the Facebook profile photos of nearby people, but does not show a map of where they are, and it only summarizes the number of friends and interests in common. If you click through to the other person’s profile page, then you’ll see a list of Facebook friends in common as well as their interests versus yours.
The app compares your Likes in common with Wikipedia listings to identify similar categorical interests. Examples I’ve seen: If the other person likes The New Yorker, a line of text might say “You like The Econoimst.” If they like The Sopranos, it says “You like Mad men.” Sometimes these comparisons end up better than others, but overall the feature does succeed in showing you things loosely in common that might not have been obvious if you only compare Likes.
The app also goes very easy on notifications. During the past week I’ve been using Glancee, it’s sent maybe ten of them to me. I have to go to the app to see who’s nearby.
If you want to talk to anyone, a chat feature lets you message or voice call with them. A “News” tab on the home page shows you people with an especially large number of commonalities, as well as people who have visited your profile, or the activity of people you’ve communicated with. Also, the app goes very easy on your battery life.
In terms of future business models, Glancee’s ideas are along the lines of other location apps: targeting nearby ads, deals, etc. based on the users behavior.
Before I share my personal opinion about Glancee, I should point out that there are many other location apps that somehow use ambient location to try to create quality new connections. But very few are directly comparable to each other. Glancee cofounder Andrea Vaccari noted on my Highlight post that there’s also JoinMingle, Gatsby, Ban.jo, Shoutflow, Blendr, and Unsocial. And of course, there are many more location apps that have been around for years, like Loopt and Foursquare, not to mention Google Latitude or Facebook Places.
Briefly, here are the other things that some of these non-checkin apps are trying to do. JoinMingle is explicitly for professional networking, Gatsby provides a very opaque means of connecting in that it pairs you with specific people for one-hour-limited conversations, Ban.jo aggregates every other location service that it can, Blendr is dating-oriented, and Unsocial is designed around meeting people at conferences and other events. Shoutflow is the most similar that I’ve seen to Highlight and Glancee, but it’s not available in the US iTunes App Store so I haven’t personally used it. So, none of these apps appear to be that directly competitive to Glancee and Highlight (there’s lots more to say about each of these other apps, but they’re not what this article is about, sorry).

Glancee and Highlight are the ones that I’ve used that have provided social experiences that I have found to be meaningful. But, because I live in San Francisco and I’m a tech reporter, Highlight has been much more visceral for me. Being able to see exactly where other users are in relation to me makes a big difference considering that I’m in a city of hundreds of thousands of people sandwiched in a few square miles. So does the fact that it only shows people in a few blocks radius. And so does the fact that I get pinged by it whenever anyone is near. These are crucial subtle differences that totally reshape the user experience. Specifically, Highlight has been connecting me with long-lost friends and interesting new people in the tech world, who I’ve ended up having impromptu meetings with, and Glancee hasn’t.
But that’s just my tech-bubble perspective. Glancee is doing a lot of things right, and considering that a large portion of the US population does not live in dense urban areas, this could be the app for them. If you’re in a suburb or a spread-out small city or a rural area, the miles-radius range is more appropriate, and a neighborhood map is less relevant. Also, if you don’t like aggressive notifications and you like a long battery life, you’re going to like it more than Highlight.
But there’s always this caveat: Ambient location is not just something to build a company around, it is a feature that Facebook or Foursquare or any other big company doing location could also do very easily. I wouldn’t be surprised to see them test ambient out if any of these startups get serious traction. So readers, may each of you find the ambient location app that’s right for you."	2012-02-09	495122	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/slide1.png?w=400	startups/	Glancee: A Nice-Guy Ambient Social Location App For Normal People		https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/09/glanceelocationapp/	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2586	Josh Constine	Apps	"6 months after its public launch, the RockMelt social web browser now has 1.4 million registered users and several hundred thousand weekly active users, CEO and co-founder Eric Vishria told me this morning. With Internet Explorer and Firefox on the decline, RockMelt’s 2012 will be defined by competition with Chrome. Google’s browser is moving in the direction of RockMelt, adding login for personalization and an app store. To stay unique, Vishria says “I think we should push further ahead”, building radical new features “everyone will ultimately want”. But will RockMelt arrive too early to the browser revolution?
Finding the right design to make deep functionality easily accessible is the goal of RockMelt 5 beta, which will be released on Wednesday. The team is aiming for Apple-esque intuitive design. “We haven’t gotten gotten to the ‘iPhone of the browser space’, but that’s where the future lies,” says Vishria
Fortunately, RockMelt’s user base is young and highly adaptive, with 60% under age 25. They have the highest retention, use its special features the most, and invite friends to download RockMelt the most. Vishria seemed very excited about this, “If you’re building a browser for the next generation, it’s good to see the next generation using it.”
The average RockMelt user has the browser installed on 1.3 machines, and uses it for 7 hours a day. They have 12 apps installed, use them 26 times a day, and have 7 chat conversations a day up, from 3 just six months ago. These engagement stats are nice, but user acquisition and retention is where the service has had trouble. I’ve used all the iterations and haven’t been convinced to stick with it yet.

To leapfrog Chrome and accelerate the shift to more personalized, social browser, Vishria says RockMelt is focusing on 3 key areas:
RockMelt has also started to monetize its users, though this depends on its competitor Google. When people search through the RockMelt address bar, Google search results are shown generating a few dollars per user a year. Thanks to its $40 million in funding, monetization doesn’t have to be a priority right now. Instead, Vishria tells me the agenda is “Product. Distribution. Monetization. The big opportunity is in getting to hundreds of millions of users.”
I have reservations about RockMelt reaching this goal, though. Pioneering the future of the browser and attaining a mainstream audience may be fundamentally at odds. Chrome doubled its market share to 25% this year through speed and simplicity, not features.

2587	Sarah Buhr	Apps	"Remember Ello? The social network that promises to be ad-free will drop an iPhone app starting tomorrow, June 18. The announcement about the app is already on the homepage of the Ello website in big flashing words that read “Coming June 18th.”
The company also sent me a very cryptic box of thingamajigs today. Something that looks like a piece of bread made out of wood, some t-shirts and a USB card with a press kit announcing the iOS app.

Ello quickly became a favorite site to check out as an alternative to Facebook in the fall of 2014. Everyone wanted an invite. The site received 31,000 invite requests per hour at one point, according to the startup.
We came, we saw and we kinda forgot about it.
Though co-founder Paul Budnitz said there were “millions of people using Ello on the web” in a company statement, Ello has so far remained secretive about its growth numbers. But the frenzy lasted long enough for the team behind the social networking site to nab $5.5 million in funding.
Ello has so far used that money to redesign the site and create the aforementioned iOS app and a planned app for Android.
But will any of this get users to want to go to there? Ello pitched itself as a Facebook alternative for those who don’t like being bombarded with ads. Yet people didn’t leave Facebook for Ello. In fact, many of those talking about Ello were posting about it on Facebook.

TechCrunch’s own Josh Constine compared going up against Facebook to “punching a wall 1.35 billion bricks thick.”
There have been a number of other social networks that have attempted and failed to unseat Facebook before (ahem, Google+). And Ello, for all its ideals, didn’t offer much incentive for folks to switch. You can block Facebook ads with ad-blocking software.
Even with the funding and redesign, Ello still offers pretty much the same thing as most other social networks – an easier way to find your friends (something seriously buggy in its first iteration of the site), search, real-time alerts, private messaging, private groups and something called “Loves,” which allow users to show support for a post. Those posts are then put together in a stream of posts for users.
Ello’s mobile app promises to remain ad-free and includes an address import feature. But the redesign and app are quite close to what most other social networks already offer. It’s not enough to exist with one extra feature considering the larger, more successful social networks Ello is up against."	2015-06-17	1172695	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/screen-shot-2015-06-17-at-1-16-24-pm.png?w=738	social/	Ello, The Ad-Free Social Network, Wants You To Know It Will Have An iPhone App Tomorrow		https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/elloelloanybodyrememberus/	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2646	Dan Leberman	eCommerce	"

The holiday season is here, and shoppers and merchants alike are gearing up for the busiest shopping season of the year. How will technology impact retail this season, and what’s new in 2015 about the ancient “art of the sale”?
eMarketer predicts a happy holiday season for retailers this year, with U.S. retail sales in the months of November and December increasing 5.7 percent year over year, reaching $885.7 billion. E-commerce is expected to account for 9 percent of total retail sales this season, or $79.4 billion, up from 8.3 percent share last year.
Not surprisingly, mobile commerce will play a bigger part in e-commerce growth this holiday season than in years past. eMarketer expects U.S. retail m-commerce sales to rise 32.2 percent in full-year 2015 — more than double the 14.2 percent increase forecast for retail e-commerce sales as a whole.
The biggest growth will come in smartphone retail m-commerce sales, as consumers become more comfortable buying on their mobile devices. Retailers are quickly adapting to this increased demand for simple mobile shopping with mobile-friendly websites and apps that make shopping on the go as easy as checking your email or sending a text.
But there’s something even more interesting brewing in the world of mobile commerce. It’s called contextual commerce, and it blends the power of mobile devices and their inherent data about their owners’ preferences with consumers’ presence in the real world. For example, when finishing up a meal at your favorite restaurant, your mobile device can pay the check via your OpenTable app, and also ask you if you’re ready for a ride home via Uber or Lyft.
When out shopping with friends, your phone may be able to notify you that the hard-to-find perfume you’ve been considering buying for your girlfriend is available at the shop on the corner.  As our devices become even smarter about our choices, desires and preferences, our mobile phones become the ultra-simple “remote control” for our lives, simplifying and enabling all of our daily transactions.
Social media will also play a big role in this brave new world of e-commerce. Billions of us already use social media platforms such as Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram for keeping in touch with friends and family and discovering more about our world, and also for learning about new products and services. Social media platforms also provide a wealth of information for merchants regarding our purchases, interests, browsing history and preferences, as well as those of our connections.
This vast data network of posts, recommendations, associations, views, likes and dislikes within a trusted “word-of-mouth” context creates a vast web of information that is incredibly useful to marketers. The information is being used today by merchants to deliver relevant information about products and services that are of interest to us or to someone we may know. The next logical step, of course, is to monetize this data network even further and shorten the journey for consumers from discovery to transaction or purchase.
Already many shops and merchants offer discounts to shoppers for doing things like checking in online via social media. This year we’ll begin to see the emergence of “shoppable social,” whereby you’ll be able to easily make a purchase or claim an offer from directly within the Facebook, Pinterest or Instagram app on your mobile device.
So instead of just learning about new products via ads or recommendations from friends, you’ll be able to more easily “close the deal” without clicking away from your social media app. This “shoppable social” brand of commerce is an obvious win for merchants who will be able to leverage the data from social media and mobile devices to target the best customers at the most appropriate moment. It’s also great for consumers who won’t need to waste time with irrelevant ads and content that simply does not apply to them.
Here are a few ideas for integrating contextual commerce and social media strategies into an existing marketing program, which can help merchants add customers and increase sales this holiday season.
Deliver native, interactive product experiences for each social media channel
Merchants should enable easy sharing of their content within the context of each target social media channel for viewing, commenting, rating, and further sharing. Consumers trust the opinions of their friends and associates more than they trust traditional advertising and marketing campaigns. Smart merchants will leverage this and rely on the trust between friends that is now finding new modes of expression and distribution via social media platforms.
Reward customers for sharing with incentive and loyalty programs
The holidays are an ideal time to build and nurture customer relationships with incentive and loyalty programs that reward current and new customers for sharing their positive experiences with your brand and products on their social media networks. Current customers will appreciate rewards such as 15 percent off their next purchase for sharing their positive experience, and such programs will also help win new customers.
These instant incentives can be part of longer-term loyalty programs that reward current customers and encourage new customers to continue their engagement. Merchants should prominently display these opportunities and rewards for social engagement in their social media posts, websites and mobile sites, and make it as easy as possible to share the love.
Implement buy buttons for instant, seamless checkout
The buy button is essential in contextual commerce for ensuring a convenient, effortless, quick and seamless sale following a customer’s exposure to an item on a social media platform. Merchants should also implement the buy button for instant sales, with as little additional input required as possible, on their website e-commerce and mobile-commerce platforms.
That way, customers have the same convenience wherever they choose to purchase — across all channels. Payments partners can integrate social media channels with merchant e-commerce platforms for seamless checkout.
The ancient and most trusted form of sales and marketing, word-of-mouth, has found a new, amplified and more efficient voice in social media. Contextual commerce brings this ancient tradition to fruition with modern engagement and sales technology. While the ancient and enduring holiday spirit of good will can never be digitized, contextual commerce makes the act of giving easier, simpler and more intelligent than ever before."	2015-11-29	1242434	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mobile-ecommerce-shopping.png?w=738	social/	The New Wave Of Selling On Mobile And Social		https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/29/the-new-wave-of-selling-on-mobile-and-social/	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2736	Rip Empson	Apps	"Since its name began appearing on blogs and in media early last year, and launched officially at DEMO in March, Pixable has been able to sustain that buzz — no easy feat in a world saturated with photo apps. That’s because millions of photos and videos are shared on social networks every day, making it difficult to find the ones that matter amidst the noise. So, Pixable pulls that fire hose of images and videos from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, YouTube, and Vimeo, aggregates them in one place, and then gives users a number of sleek categorization, sorting, and editing tools to help them find the most relevant content.
This is where Pixable’s true value proposition lies: In its “WonderRank” technology, which crawls users’ networks to find out what’s interested them in the past, what relationships are valued most,  using commonalities in background information (like school, work history, etc.), to serve the best content. Its machine learning and algorithmic mix takes over 70 signals into account, getting smarter the more you use the app, organizing photos and videos into a number of fields, like most popular of the day, week, month, showing which users changed profile pics, what photos and videos are most recent, etc.
As Pixable has continued to expand its functionality (check out our posts here), users have responded. Pixable CEO and Co-founder Inaki Berenguer tells us that people are currently viewing 2,000 photos across its iOS (and Facebook) apps per minute, with over 100 million views on average per month. 
The app has seen over 1.5 million downloads since April of last year, but what’s interesting is that most of those downloads have come recently. After launching in April, Pixable saw about 1,000 downloads per month, reaching 3,355 downloads by the end of August and jumping to 137,000 by the end of October, and 790K on December 1st. By the beginning of February, the apps were nearing 1.5 million downloads. So, while it technically took nine months to reach 1m downloads, its growth has hockey-sticked in the last four months. (Part of this the team attributes to Apple’s featuring Pixable on the App Store.)

Of course downloads are one thing, but active, engaged users are the important metric. The team tells us that over 60 percent of the app’s total installs were active in January. Not too shabby. As our lives become increasingly saturated by photo and video sharing, people yearn for better ways to filter the noise — not just on a single platform, but from all of the sources of photo and video content we use daily.
In this way, the team hopes that its categorization and filtering features can increase the stickiness of its user experience. To do that, and press past being a “priority inbox” for photos on social platforms, Pixable is today launching a feature that will allow users to group images on its platform using hashtags — a la Twitter. 
 Users can tag their own (and their friends’) photos with terms like #awesomeness, #graduation, #ripcrunch, etc. The goal is to take photo-tagging beyond its focus on people, and extend that group categorization to the rest of the nouns, i.e. places and things, to improve discovery and recommendations of photo content. (This sounds like a similar approach to that of Tracks, another cool photo sharing tool we’ve covered.)
Like Twitter, Pixable will group together photos hashtagged based on shared keywords and highlight popular trending hashtags so users can search based on topic/keyword. In the photo mess, it’s a great way to enable easy recall of photos based around events, like TC Disrupt, or your cat’s birthday party. 
It’s a smart move, applying those successful Twitter mechanics that have worked for social networks and photo sharing sites alike — Instagram has been hashtagging for over a year now. But obviously, this brings that feature to images from all your networks, hashtaggregating, if you will. Initially, hashtagging will only be available on Pixable’s iPhone app, but it plans to integrate this feature across platforms in the next few months.
The NYC-based startup has raised just over $6.1 million to date.

2779	Frederic Lardinois	Education	"Duolingo is probably the most popular mobile education app, but until now, the company’s focus has been solely on language learning. Today, the company is expanding its reach by launching Tinycards for iOS, its first app that can be used for learning virtually anything that involves memorization: vocabulary, equations, history facts and every Pokémon’s name and stats (I’m not kidding; that is indeed a set of cards already available in Tinycards).
At its core, Tinycards is a flashcards app that uses the same spaced repetition technique as similar apps, but in the backend, it also uses the same algorithms as the Duolingo app to adapt to every learner’s individual progress.
“Duolingo redefined the way millions of people learn languages by making it fun, effective and free,” said Duolingo CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn in today’s announcement. “We’re excited to bring that experience to flashcards in order to help school kids suffering through memorization for tests. We also hope this will motivate adults to learn new topics to enhance their lives.”
Like Duolingo, Tinycards gamifies the learning experiences. Users can unlock new levels and share cards with friends, for example. What’s really different here, though, is that it’s Duolingo’s first app that isn’t all about languages (though it can definitely also be used for that).
Duolingo made an early version of Tinycards available to me for testing. When you first launch the app, you get to choose which flashcard creators you want to follow. Right now, most of the featured creators are from Duolingo itself. You can choose between Duolingo for language cards, TinyHistory for historical events, TinyScience, TinyGeo and Chineasy, which Duolingo partnered with to bring its popular system for learning Chinese to Tinycards.
To try the app, I opted for the Hiragana course. Duolingo sadly itself doesn’t yet offer a Japanese course, but these cards will help you read some basic characters for your next trip to Tokyo.
Using the app feels similar to using Duolingo. You’ll first see the fronts and backs of the cards and then answer questions about them. In the case of the Japanese characters, that means identifying the letters, typing them, etc. This isn’t going to teach you Japanese, of course, but it would definitely make for a nice addition to an introductory course. The app also features card decks for learning basic phrases and animal names in Japanese.
Other card sets currently featured in the app range from those that will teach you the basics of the Russian alphabet to the countries of Europe. I also used the Old English card deck to bring back some of that working vocabulary I once had when I translated Beowulf many years ago (there is also a Beowulf deck, too, of course). One nice feature for language-learning cards is that the app also allows you to record audio and attach it to a card.

The company says the app already features “hundreds of beautifully illustrated decks.” If you want to make your own card decks, you can do that, too — and anybody within the app can follow your updates and your followers will be notified when you launch a new deck. So if you are an expert in a certain area, you can now use Tinycards to help others learn about your passion, too.
Sadly, it’s not clear when Duolingo plans to launch an Android version of this new app, though chances are it’s already in the works, given that the company has always been good about supporting Google’s mobile operating system.
Duolingo has now raised $83.3 million. It doesn’t look like the company plans to monetize Tinycards for now, though."	2016-07-19	1355035	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/duolingo_three_tinycards.png?w=738	mobile/	Duolingo wants to reinvent flashcards with Tinycards		https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/19/duolingo-wants-to-reinvent-flashcards-with-tinycards/	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
2911	Josh Constine	Apps	"Sick of lonely nights at home browsing feeds? Free tells you which friends are…free…and let’s you ask if anyone wants to meet up without making you look desperate. Launching today on iOS, Free lets you announce plans or that you’re flexible, and group chat to organize your congregation. It’s like a green dot online status indicator for your real-life availability.
Free was co-founded by Path’s Danny Trinh, a true man-about-town with insights from his ex-employer’s missteps. “It was so frustrating. We were working on a core utility that everybody already had a behavior pattern for elsewhere” Trinh tells me.
But instead of another photo sharer or Facebook clone, he’s raised $1.9 million from top seed funds like Social+Capital, Google Ventures, Lowercase, First Round, and SV Angel to fill an emptiness in our lives. Free adds transparency to spontaneity so we know when we could spend time together.
You can check out a quick demo video of Free below:
	
Gathering with a few pals can turn a meal, weekend, post-work drink, or late night chill out into something memorable. While Foursquare, Facebook Nearby Friends, Plancast, and many more have tried and failed, Free nails the nuances necessary to get us out of our shells.
I’ve thought a lot about these nuances myself. Why are people scared to say they’re not doing anything? Who do you notify when someone’s available? How do you keep people from feeling ignored? That’s because a year ago I advised a startup called Signal trying to do the exact same thing as Free. After frustrations on these key points, the founder moved on to another project and Signal is possibly permanent stasis.
Yet Free seems to have figured them out with subtle language and clever design tricks. I’m an extreme extrovert, and one of the only people I see out as much as me is this 24-year-old spitfire Danny Trinh. If anyone could build this, it’s him.
The other big contenders like Foursquare and Facebook Nearby friends missed the mark by focusing on where we are, not what we want to do and who to do it with. A friend checking in at the bar down the street isn’t an invitation.

Trinh left Path a year and a half ago to start Free. He had realized “I could sit on the couch and browse feeds for hours and it kinda made me sad.” But blindly reaching out to friends to see if they wanted to hangout seemed dorky. That type of communication didn’t fit with the “Success Theater” of Facebook that he’d read about in a New York Times piece by Jenna Wortham. We hide the uncool parts of our lives and only share what will get plenty of likes. He needed to build a new app that didn’t bruise our egos when we desire connection.
“Steve Jobs said the computer is the bicycle for the mind” Trinh tells me. “I wanted social bicycle, the thing that made the manual, tedious process of finding friends and getting them together way more efficient.” So Trinh poached an old colleague from Digg, Kelvin Kakugawa, away from his job at Goldman Sachs and they started relentlessly iterating on the idea for Free. After several scrapped versions, today it’s ready for the public.
The core of Free is a cartoony status composer that lets you say that you’re Going Out, Flexible, or Busy. You can also add some text, a location, time frame, or tag friends to suggest what you might do together. These statuses go into Free’s feed that you can quickly flick through to all your friends’ plans, and disappear the next morning. And you can kill off your status at any time if plans change.

If you say you’re Going Out or Flexible, a push notification will go to friends in your current city that you added through your phone contacts or Twitter. If you want to do something more private, you can choose to notify just a subset of your friends, or mute the status so people don’t get pinged and will only see it in the Free feed. Anyone who’s Busy won’t be bothered so they don’t get FOMO.
Using the term “Flexible” is an extraordinarily smart move. It can mean you’re not doing anything, but doesn’t seem nearly as embarrassing to broadcast.
Friends can respond to your Free status in a private message thread. If they can’t join you, Free lets them choose from a few pre-populated decline messages like “Miss you” or “Hang soon!” This avoids people being met with silence when they post a status, which could deter them in the future.

Everyone who says they can join gets placed into a group chat thread where they can organize meet up plans, heart each other’s messages, drop a location pin, send a photo with an emoji sticker stuck on top, or record a few-second video that’s turned into a cute auto-looping GIF.
To spark usage, Free sends out a “Weekend Roll-Call”, asking people what they’re up to on Fridays and Saturdays. There are also adorable little stickers for asking someone if they’re hungry or want to grab drinks, which make it even easier to reach out in private message threads. My favorite is Street Fighter’s E. Honda doing his Hundred Hand Slap attack in the “Hit Me Up” sticker.
Free even works with people who don’t have the app. If you select a contact from your phone as a favorite, they’ll get text messages with your Free status. That oughta help with growth since it’s not on Android yet, though it is coming to Apple Watch.
Overall, Free feels lightweight yet does enough things texting can’t that makes it worth using. It unlocks the potential of our leisure time.
Don’t let the name fool you. Trinh has plans to make Free a business and make good on his $1.9 million seed from Social + Capital Partnership, True Ventures, Google Ventures, Chris Sacca’s Lowercase Capital, First Round Capital, SV Angel, Homebrew Ventures, Cowboy Ventures, Upside Partnership, Slow Ventures, Bobby Goodlatte, Hugo Barra, and his old boss Dave Morin.
Trinh speaks of expanding to helping you meet new people, but non-dating apps in that space like Highlight haven’t seen much traction. Free should do this naturally when friends bring their buddies with them to hang out.
The real opportunity is connecting people who’ve expressed intent to do something like get dinner or drinks with the businesses that sell these experiences. It’s easy to imagine Free triangulating a restaurant between three friend who say they’re hungry, and serving you a paid suggestion to go there.
Free’s biggest challenge will be opening up this behavior pattern of announcing your availability, and tearing us away from text messaging and apps like Facebook Messenger. Teaching people something new is never easy, but the rewards of real-world interaction with people you care about could be enough to get us over the hump.
Free is never going to replace the texting giants, but it doesn’t have to. “Free is at the top of the funnel”, Trinh explains. “The hardest part about texting is not knowing who to text. If you chat in Messenger after finding people on Free, that’s fine. We’ve already delivered our utility.” Still, we might like the sound of Free, but inevitably slip back to texting if it can’t hold our attention.
Pointing at his phone, Trinh laments that “Before this software, all this aluminum and glass did little to impact my real world friendships.” Plenty of apps clam to make you more connected, but they’re only bonding our digital selves. Two friends alone in their homes looking at photos of each other is a pretty bleak view of connection. But if Free can gain network effect, it could change the course of our social lives."	2015-06-11	1170126	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/free-app.png?w=738	mobile/	“Free” Shows Which Friends Are Available To Hang Out		https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/11/get-free/	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2967	Ingrid Lunden	Mobile	"Daniel Raffel says that when he started work on the app that eventually became the how-to platform Snapguide, people advised him to make a “food guide” app (he has worked as a chef so might naturally gravitate to that vertical).
He resisted, possibly because he had a bigger ambition in mind: “My goal is to inspire people to make things that they might otherwise buy,” he told me in a conversation earlier this week. In an online/offline world filled with lots of ways to consume just about anything you want, wherever and whenever you want, Snapguide is one of those places that runs counter to that, and its flavor of DIY — delivered via a series of mobile-friendly, photographic and video-led how-to guides covering everything including crafts, makeup, cars, and, yes, food — is growing.
Launching in March 2012, Snapguide’s still small — just nine employees — but something that Raffel has tried to put into place is an emphasis not just on technology but also design. Currently the ratio of designers to developers is 2:1 there are six engineers and three designers. “An insane ratio,” he calls it. “It’s not shocking usually to see 1 designer to 15 engineers.” He believes this is part of what’s helping Snapguide get one up over would-be competitors. “We’re in a space where competition is still on desktop and they’ve not worked out yet how to do it on mobile.”
Raffel says that he considers Snapguide a “design driven” company, giving an attention to detail that he says was reinforced by his experience working as a chef. “The experiences I want to build are deeply considered. It’s not just slapped together.”
Snapguide recently picked up another designer to help with that goal: Rebecca Bortman, who joined Snapguide in January as a product designer. She is a catch, having come from YouTube, where she led the design team in YouTube’s first major refresh in seven years. She will work with creative lead Edwin Tofslie. “We are super excited to have her working with all of us in a product designer capacity where she is lending her amazing visual and interaction skills in addition to her product management chops,” says Raffel. (And in addition to her singing chops — she also sings in punk band Happy Fangs and previously was in My First Earthquake.)
Raffel says Snapguide is currently growing at three-digit percentage points per month (2.5 times in the last 30 days). It passed one million unique visitors in November across both apps and web, and is now “well past that,” said Raffel. Searches on the site also passed the one million mark in January. Today it’s having one of its biggest traffic day ever Raffel says, a result of a “combination of search traffic, Pinterest traffic, and ton coming from Reddit.”
The social pinboard Pinterest, as it happens, is proving to be one of Snapguide’s biggest and most consistent sources of traffic — Snapguide’s pictures and general purpose lend themself to how Pinterest is used and explored as a social pinboard of interesting ideas and concepts, and it has the distinction of being the first iOS app with Pinterest integration, shy of an official Pinterest API. And for those who have wondered why Snapguide has yet to develop an Android app, Pinterest is partly to blame for that:
“Pinterest is driving nearly as many page views per month as Google,” says Raffel, “and one of the things that’s really interesting is that we see a large perentage of Pinterest traffic coming from Pinterest on iOS. The traffic shows that iOS is the place to focus for now. It’s mouth droppingly shocking how much mobile traffic comes from iOS and how much comes from Android. It just reinforces that social services are performing exponentially better on iOS.”
That traffic from iOS is one of the reasons why Snapguide has decided to keep developing on iOS before expanding to other platforms. Starting first with its iOS app in March, it followed that up in December with an iPad app. There is also a much-used website, and a mobile web version — it’s the web versions that people see if they click on links from other sites.
That doesn’t mean that Snapguide is not working on Android, but right now the focus is to make iOS work better. “It’s tempting to go wide and add stuff and apps to the product base, but for a startup it’s not a small thing to take on a new project,” says Raffel.
Improvements that are coming up include small things like upgrades to basic editing on the iOS apps, as well as bigger projects like trying to make it easier for people to figure out they could learn from Snapguide, and what they should be creating to share with others. “That’s not obvious to everyone, and we want to be a place for people to get inspired,” he says.
Snapguide will also soon feature some ways to encourage more interactivity among the community: this includes what Raffel calls a “leaderboard.” “There are all these people making stuff, so why not give them some ideas?” So, the community of Snapguide users will be ask to pitch in on 10 ideas around an event like Valentine’s day. “For some people, that will inspire them to physically make a guide; for others it will inspire them to like and follow those people,” he says. “It’s been a challenging feature, something we’ve wanted to do for a long time.”
And there is likely to be more developments on Snapguide’s desktop and mobile websites. “We think that’s a place where we haven’t invested enough, based on the proportion of web traffic we get today,” which he says is “pretty significant.”
It seems fitting that one of Snapguide’s most recent hires came from YouTube. Raffel says that he views Google’s video site as Snapguide’s toughest competition at the moment. YouTube has become the home for a number of other how-to site’s video content — Howcast being one well-executed example mentioned by Raffel — and that content is easily found through search engines.
“We’re not trying to beat traditional how-to sites because they’re getting in their own way,” says Raffel. “They’ve in the past paid people to make their own content. But that doesn’t scale well and the people writing the content aren’t passionate.” The other issue is that much of their content has been created for web use, but those experiences are not that easy to transfer to mobile. “It’s millions of pieces of unique content — you can’t reformat something that large. They don’t have photos or other ways of looking good on mobile.”
While Snapguide already lets users add videos to their guides, this may be an area that will see more attention. “We feel like a lot of how-to searches do end up on YouTube, so if we don’t make experiences that compete, that will spell trouble for us,” Raffel says.
But it will likely keep video length short and not compete head-on with YouTube. “Making video is hard, snapping pictures is easy,” he says. “If you’re documenting something it’s much easier to do with photos.” Photos also are what helps Snapguide “lend itself naturally” to its big traffic-driver, Pinterest. “Every one of our guides has multiple images, and when you pin something usually it’s an image.”
Raffel would not comment on whether Snapguide is raising more money to continue growing — in June 2012 it picked up a $5 million Series A from Index Ventures, Atlas and CrunchFund, on top of a $2 million round in 2011.
But money is on Raffel’s mind in other respects. For one, it is starting to consider business models for its service.
“We’ll look at revenue sharing, allowing people to sell content. I enjoy the fact that at the moment we can be pure and not do that, but longer term it is not realistic not to do those things.” Inevitably, ads will also be considered. “When you chase advertising too early you make it a different experience, but we’re not opposed to it and don’t have an issue and I don’t think it’s a bad fit for us.”
Driving more inventory to the platform may also lead Snapguide to paying contributors. “It’s possible we might compensate,” says Raffel. “We will will always be interested in exploring what incentives motivate people to create high quality content. Maybe [creators] are getting ideas for things they can make. That might not be enough. But when you reward people financially you get back to that model where it’s not the most passionate people. It just changes the reason for sharing.”
He believes, though, that the content farm model has been proven to work effectively. Their weapon has been SEO experts who look at query traffic and “quickly rise to the occasion” to get whatever is needed made. “We should all be so responsive,” says Raffel. But he also thinks that there can be another way to achieve this, such as through Snapguide’s leaderboard concept.
There may also be partnerships in Snapguide’s horizon: Raffel wouldn’t name names, just the “sorts of brands that would be natural fits on our platform, that would complement it.”
Remember that Snapguide’s 912 employees consist of 6 engineers, 3 designers, 1 community manager, a office manager and Raffel — no business development people. That means the partnerships that are being cooked up come from third parties reaching out to Snapguide. “And the top of our list has already reached out to us,” Raffel says.
“There are certain brands making stuff on our service already, and larger partners and brands will want things like being treated specially. They want additional analytics that traditional users don’t need. They need to evaluate whether something working or not.”
He says that as an app that was created thinking about the consumer first, it would be “amazing to have a huge brand who we respect, with high quality content, sharing content with us.”
This goes back again to Raffel’s and co-founder’s Steve Krulewitz’s original concept of making the platform as wide open as consumers wanted it to be. That has ended up being a business engine, too. “The variety has not only challenged us but opened us up to a much wider audience faster,” says Raffel. “And it has created a wealth of marketing opportunities that would have otherwise been closed to us.”"	2013-02-10	754957	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/photo-1.png?w=400	social/	Visual How-To App Snapguide Passes 1M Uniques, Snaps Up YouTube Designer, And Gears Up For Growth		https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/10/visual-how-to-app-snapguide-passes-1m-uniques-snaps-up-youtube-designer-and-gears-up-for-growth/	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
2988	Anthony Ha	Mobile	"One of the startup ideas that I’ve been hearing about for years is the social photo album — a service that doesn’t just let you share photos with your friends, but also create albums with them. Adam Ludwin and Devon Gundry have seen a lot of those startups, too, but they’re trying to crack the problem with their new startup Albumatic.
Ludwin (a principal at RRE Ventures, where he led the seed round in Twitter-acquired social video startup Vine) told me that when he and Gundry (a musician who also started a social media company with actor Rainn Wilson) first started thinking about the app, they realized there were a bunch of other products that never got significant consumer traction — the most high-profile flameout was probably Color. And they decided that the key factor was location.
At this point, you might be feeling a bit skeptical, but stay with me. (Even Ludwin admitted, “When we realized that we were building a social local mobile app, we thought, ‘Are there any more clichés that we can pull out?'”) Albumatic isn’t about sharing photos with your friends later on, nor is it about randomly connecting with people nearby. Instead, it allows you to create and capture events with friends in the moment.
So for example, if you’re at a party, you can create an album for party photos on Albumatic, and if there are Albumatic users nearby who you’ve friended in the app, they’ll get a notification, allowing them to join the album and add photos (since they’re probably at the same event). Albumatic friends who are further away can “watch” the album and get notified when new photos get added. It effectively turns a photo album into a real-time event, and at the end you’ve got a nice record of the party. Ludwin described his approach as, “fun and done.”
One of the challenges facing any app like this is making sure there are enough users and enough content that early users don’t feel like they’re just sharing photos into a void. Ludwin argued that even if you have only one other friend on Albumatic, it should be worthwhile, because you suddenly have access to all these photos that they’ve taken and albums that they’ve joined. One of the most important goals, he added, was to make sure the app could be used regularly at casual events: “Do not build a weddings app. As soon as you go down that road, you’ve failed.”
In the early testing, Ludwin said he’s noticed that during the week, people tend to use Albumatic as a way to share photos with their friends from solo outings. Then when the weekend starts, it’s “game on” and you start to have more group albums.
I tried out the app last night. Since it was a Wednesday, it was definitely solo mode — I shared photos from my dinner in one album, while browsing photos of the Albumatic team as it prepared for launch. Even so, it was actually pretty fun, and I’m looking to trying it out more heavily this weekend. (It helped that Ludwin and Gundry kept liking and commenting on my photos — keep it up guys!)
As for the business model, Ludwin said there’s nothing concrete right now, but he noted that there are opportunities for additional premium services around things like photo quality and storage. He was also adamant that the Albumatic app will always be free and that it will never run ads.
By the way, Ludwin said he plans to remain at RRE while also working on Albumatic: “Should be a busy time! But fun.”

3032	Sarah Perez	Apps	"It’s not exactly a Netflix or YouTube rival, but AT&T-backed Fullscreen is hoping to carve out its own niche in the now-crowded subscription video market with its new service, launched this week. The $5 per month offering includes a mix of shorter, original content alongside full-length Hollywood movies and TV shows, like “Hitch,” “Dawson’s Creek,” and “Saved by the Bell,” for example.
At launch, the company says there’s over 800 hours of content available for streaming, in an app that works across iPhone, iPad, Android smartphones, Chromecast, and via the web at Fullscreen.com.
Content
Unlike YouTube, where the majority of content comes from user-generated videos, Fullscreen’s original lineup involves several scripted series, like its reboot of a 1970’s TV series, “Electra Woman and Dyna Girl,” featuring YouTube stars Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart, which focuses on the lives and adventures of two under-appreciated crime fighters.

Other shows speak to familiar and popular formulas for teen fare.
For example, “Filthy Preppy Teen$” may appeal to the demographic who watches things like “Pretty Little Liars,” or the CW network. “Making Moves” combines the popularity of dance shows and their creative choreography with a scripted series about trying to make it in L.A.
Unscripted series include “My Selfie Life,” plus unfiltered conversations on shows like “Shane & Friends,” “Zall Good with Alexis G. Zall” and “Kingdom Geek.”
Meanwhile, nods to teen and millennial culture are rife throughout Fullscreen’s app and its videos.
For instance, its docu-series called “My Selfie Life” has an episode featuring a subject who lost 200 pounds via Instagram; “#O2LForever” follows a YouTube supergroup as they embark on their North American tour; and within the first 5 minutes of “Electra Woman…,” the main characters have dropped pop culture references to both Tumblr and Snapchat.

Plus, the app cheekily organizes its content into sections whose titles reference the way teen and young adults watch videos today. That is, if they’re not watching a few-minute short piece of content on their mobile, then they’re spending hours bingeing their way through a multi-season series.
Fullscreen’s app almost too-cleverly calls this out, with sections like “I’ve Got Like 10 Min,” “Hurry, Make Me Laugh,” or “Binge On This.”
Other section titles are also written as if penned by teens who don’t give AF.
In fact, one featuring dramas is actually called “Dark AF.” Other sections include “Girls Run the World,” where you’ll find everything from “Daria” to Beyoncé, “Romance Me,” “LMFAO,” “How Dramatic,” and more.
And if you don’t want to browse by section, you can pick a show based on mood by selecting whether you want to “snack” or “binge” and then how you want to feel (e.g.”laughing till it hurts,” “getting weird,” etc.)

Not Just Video, A Social Platform 
One of Fullscreen’s defining features is its in-app video player, which offers a button that, when tapped, lets you create GIFs that you can add captions to then share across social networks, including Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.
This GIF-making function is amazingly simple to use. It’s clever too – making and sharing GIFs of TV shows and movies is a popular way that today’s young adults socialize around content, and Fullscreen has made this activity a core part to its streaming service.
In addition, a social section in the app lets you follow other people’s GIFs, where you can flip between streams of the most popular items and those that were just created. You can grab these GIFs, too, and share them with your networks. And you can give them a Facebook-like “thumbs up” or leave a comment.

Like everything else on Fullscreen, the GIFs speak to the young audience on the app with jokes about Coachella, Tinder, internet outages, “Becky with the good hair,” Uber, texting and finals.
Yep, this isn’t your mom’s Netflix over here. And that’s the point.
According to comments from Fullscreen CEO George Strompolos, the goal with Fullscreen is to function as something like an MTV for today’s generation, who grew up watching online video, not traditional TV.
“If you were to relaunch a network like MTV today, how would you do it? You would probably do it in an over-the-top environment,” he said earlier. “You would probably do it with the new generation of creators who have captured the hearts and minds of the youth, and you would probably deliver it in a mobile-first experience.”
Fullscreen is owned by Otter Media, a joint venture between AT&T and Chernin Group, and represents AT&T’s attempt to enter the mobile video market. AT&T will not only help to distribute the app to its subscribers, it’s also co-producing premium content for the service.
That makes Fullscreen a competitor to [TechCrunch parent] Verizon’s newly launched go90 mobile video service. But the biggest differentiator here is the fact that go90 is ad-supported instead of paid. But similar to AT&T’s strategic partnership with Fullscreen, Verizon has also taken its own stake in rival media network AwesomenessTV to flesh out its own exclusive, original content.
Comcast also has its stakes in the streaming market with its mobile-friendly, over-the-top service Stream, NBCU’s comedy-focused SeeSo, and its own YouTube wannabe Watchable.
The question now is how many of these niche competitors the market has room for under Netflix, Amazon and YouTube’s shadow.
At a press event earlier this week, Fullscreen COO Andy Forssell said the company believes it can reach 5 million subscribers, The WSJ reported, but it didn’t offer a time frame as to when it expects to meet that goal."	2016-04-29	1315047	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/screen-shot-2016-04-29-at-1-46-25-pm.png?w=738	mobile/	Fullscreen’s new streaming service aims to be the MTV for the YouTube generation		https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/29/fullscreens-new-streaming-service-aims-to-be-the-mtv-for-the-youtube-generation/	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
3054	Josh Constine	Mobile	"Leaked emails from the Sony hack revealed Snapchat quietly acquired a QR code startup called Scan.me late last year, and now we know why. Yesterday alongside Discover, Snapchat launched a new feature called Snaptags that creates a unique QR code for every Snapchat user. When someone points their Snapchat camera at a Snaptag, the app adds the corresponding person as a friend.
While unnamed in the UI, hacker Graham Smith sniffed the HTTP requests and found the code calls these QRs “Snaptags.”
The feature could solve a big problem for Snapchat: it’s a chore to follow people.
Since users find each other through often cryptic or goofy screen names, typing them in can be clumsy. Telling someone to “Go to Snapchat, go to add friends, and type in my weird name” is annoying.
Now you can just say “Point your Snapchat camera at this image” and boom, they’ve added you. If you want to try it out, here’s mine, which you can follow for cynical snaps and goofy skits about the crazy gadgets and startups I come across.

The feature works well if you see a Snaptag on your computer, but not on mobile since the laws of physics prevent you from photographing something on your screen. If Snapchat was smart, they’d find a way to let you upload screenshots of Snaptags from your phone’s gallery to add people, the same way Facebook Rooms’ screenshottable QR codes work.
Snaptags will be huge for Snapchat’s rapidly growing community of creators that use Snapchat Stories to entertain millions of fans. They can easily toss their Snaptag up on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook to score more followers.
Now it makes sense why Snapchat would want to pay $50 million for Scan.me, which built a system to connect QR codes to people’s identities.
Over the summer, Snapchat employee Steve Hwang emailed board members to tell them about an acquisition that would be “Super secret as usual (won’t be announced publicly),” of a company that “specializes in QR scanning/creation as well as iBeacon tech.” He explained that “7 engineers from Utah, will be moving out in the coming weeks.”

Snaptags and Discover have a similar goal of getting people to spend more time on Snapchat. Snaptags help you connect to more friends and creators so you have more stuff to look at. And just in case you don’t have many friends or can’t find stars you like, Discover’s content hub offers professional-grade entertainment in the form of photos, videos and news from outlets like CNN, Vice and Comedy Central.
Snapchat is often thought of as just a messaging app. Snaptags show its ambition to be a full-fledged social network."	2015-01-28	1111996	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/snaptag.png?w=738	social/	Snapchat Lets You Add People Via QR Snaptags Thanks To Secret Scan.me Acquisition		https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/28/snaptags/	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
3055	Steve O'Hear	Europe	"Anything that helps hotels improve their customer service levels is welcome in my book. Tools to help them upsell, not quite so much.
To that end, LoungeUp, a startup that provides a platform to enable hotels to jump on the mobile app bandwagon, has announced that it’s raised a seed round of “several hundred thousand euros” from Pôle Capital and several Angels, including Nicolas Baudy (previously VoyagesSNCF and Weekendesk), Francesco Maio (NowFashion, Attractive World), and Didier Herrmann (ex President of Unilog).
LoungeUp’s mobile app which runs on tablets, smartphones and laptops (via native and browser-based versions) is designed to help hotels keep their guests happy through a better interface for hotel services as well local partnerships — and the ability to up sell in new ways.
Specifically, the app offers things like access to practical information about the hotel and its surroundings (reserve a table in a local restaurant etc.), access to entertainment content, help desk, and social networking. The latter is perhaps most disruptive, and competes with a host of ambient social networking apps and seems pretty cutting edge for the hotels that take up the option.
As for competitors to LoungeUp’s offering, these appear to fall into two camps. First up are old incumbents who provide some of the same functionality via the interactive television systems found in lonely hotel rooms. And then there’s newer, mobile players, such as Mobil eMedia’s UStay or Stay Interactive — although LoungeUp says that it’s unique in respect of offering a single app rather than expecting guests to download something specific for each hotel they stay in. Instead, guests are given a pass code upon check-in or when booking that unlocks said hotel’s ‘portal’ within the app.
The funds will be used by LoungeUp to accelerate its commercialisation and to expand its partners list both in the startup’s native France and elsewhere in Europe, says LoungeUp CEO Mathieu Pollet.

3088	Steve O'Hear	Europe	"Even an app for affluent people needs cash at some point. Lime&Tonic, the digital concierge app for iOS that provides personalised recommendations of “unforgettable” experiences to help users fill their social agendas, has announced that it’s closed a €1 million round of angel funding.
The list of backers includes VCs Julie Meyer (Ariadne Capital), Cem Sortoglu (Earlybird Capital), Daniel Lynch (3TS Capital), and Miroslav Boublik (Craig Capital), all of whom have invested in a personal capacity, along with Graham Potts, co-founder of Jobsite.
The round also looks like it’s been a while in the making. Meyer, for example, joined the Board and became a shareholder in Lime&Tonic back in July, while Sortoglu and Lynch were also previously named as Board members.
The UK startup says it will use the new funding to further develop the Lime&Tonic product, which currently consists of a web version and iOS app only. Cheapskate Android users need not apply — for now.
The Lime&Tonic app provides personalised offers of things to do, such as dining, afternoon tea and other affluent people’s activities, provided by the premium merchants that Lime&Tonic works with. These include Michelin restaurants, and 5-star hotel brands.
Billed as a technology play, users fill out their profile with information such as any food requirements, how they like their coffee, steak cooked, or any favourite cocktails. Lime&Tonic’s algorithm then kicks in to provide those personalised recommendations, once or twice per day, powered by its database of curated experiences. 
In addition, Lime&Tonic shares elements of a user’s profile data with its partner merchants to ensure the best possible experience. The app also has a built-in calendar to help users plan upcoming events.
The service is currently available in 7 cities, including London, Dubai, Prague, Rio, Sydney, Amsterdam and Melbourne, offering 1,000+ experiences available globally from over 250 merchants. Traction-wise, Lime&Tonic says it’s delivered 85,000 paying customers to-date, up from 71,000 at the end of August."	2013-11-07	911267	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/qsutpz0rekwjafpoix209pvxemqgw0dvss0vt-2qiis-2.png?w=359	europe/	Lime&Tonic Picks Up €1M In Angel Funding Because Apps For Affluent People Need Cash Too		https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/07/lime-tonic-funding/	1	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
3197	Anthony Ha	Apps	"“Oh jeez, another Q&A app.”
That was my knee-jerk reaction when I heard about a new startup called Pyne, which has created what it says is an app that allows users to “poll the world.” But then co-founder Tony Peccatiello gave me a demo, and I have to admit that it was appealingly quick, simple and fun.
As explained to me by Peccatiello, Pyne’s main selling point is the fact that it should only take a few seconds to ask and answer questions. If you want to create a question, you just type it out, add an image, and then identify whether it’s a yes/no question or multiple choice. (If it’s multiple choice, you type in each choice. If it’s yes/no, well, the possible answers are obvious.) Lastly you can identify the audience you want to reach – men, women, Facebook friends, or everyone on Pyne.
From the answer side, you’re presented with one question at time, which you can favorite, share on social networks, comment, or, of course, answer. It’s one tap to answer a question, then you’re presented with the next one, on and on until you get sick of it.
Peccatiello said that this quick question-loading process sets Pyne apart from other apps, which often present the questions through a search or feed interface. The closest competitor may be Thumb (which merged with YPulse Research last year), but even then he said Pyne is different because it offers “a more robust answer choice,” allows answerers (whew, WordPress spellcheck says that’s really a word) to interact with each other on the results page, and allows the askers to either direct their questions as described above, or to push their question to everyone and then filter answers by different groups.
The app started out as a way for women to ask questions of men, and vice versa. While you can still see elements of that in Pyne, and while Peccatiello expects the app to feature plenty of dating- and relationship-related content, he also wanted to aim broader.
I’ve been playing with the app throughout the day, and it is quite fun, even if the questions can be pretty random. Right now I’m stumped by “Between these two which is your favorite work of fiction? A) Green Eggs and Ham B) The Bible” (Zing!) Earlier, I had to admit that I didn’t have an intelligent opinion on Bad Boys 2, because I hadn’t seen it. (Over time, Peccatiello said Pyne should get better at providing users questions that are relevant to their interests.)
The company is self-funded, with Peccatiello launching it after a stint in the finance industry. I actually first heard about it through the recommendation of TechCrunch columnist Jon Evans who worked on the app as part of the development firm Happy Fun Corp.

3204	Eric Eldon	Mobile	"Out of the slew of new location apps vying for users at SXSW this weekend, Highlight and Glancee are looking like the standouts. They both have subtle ways of connecting you to friends and new people via your phone, without invading your privacy too much. But there’s a royal rumble of competitors.
And another one of them, Kismet, has just entered the ring with a particularly forward approach to privacy that could help it win the attention melee.
It includes the background location stuff like the others, but lets you check in if you really want to declare the place you’re at. “Walking around San Francisco, I’m unlikely to check in,” chief executive Kevin Stephens explains. “But at SXSW where so many events are right on top of each other, it’s more valuable to show which event or location I actually am in order to meet new people. It’s impractical to leave a bar to go to one next door if the line is 30 minutes long.”
It also lets you do things like set up-one on-one “meetings” and ad hoc group “events” that you create and invite people to within the app. Both could be good for the conference.

Here’s the privacy twist.
The core social graph is built around Facebook like Highlight, Glancee and many of the others. You have to enable Facebook permissions when you first log in, and the app is built around the idea that you’re trying to connect with people you have things in common with.
But unlike most of the competitors, you’ll see the exact places where people are, even if you have no friends in common with them. And by exact I mean sometimes right down to the street addresses.
But!
You’ll only get exact addresses for those other users who actively check in themselves, not people who are just using the background location feature. And, the app has a unique tactic for privacy protection: it watches residential places you go to often and automatically obscures them after a few visits.
The app builds location frequency into the app in other ways. “You’ll actually see a counter of how many times you’ve both been there for places both of you have visited frequently (e.g., we both went to AT&T Park 5 times lately),” Stephens tells me. “This is to show what you have in common with someone. Where you spend your time says more about you than your Facebook likes.”

You can also see other detailed stats about other users, including the number of meeting invitations they’ve sent and the number of chats they’ve had. Stephens intends for this feature to promote good behavior.
“If someone chatted up 80 people and proposed to meet 50 of them in the past day or two,” he says, “that would send off a ‘creeper’ vibe to most women. That’s basically being the guy in the room that walks around and hits on every woman in sight. This feature is specifically to create some social pressure so people avoid anti-social behavior.”
For people who have friends in common, the interface lets you scroll through to see the degrees of separation on Facebook, up to three and four degrees of separation away.
One of my favorite features, and one that’s not available on most competitors’ apps, is a way to see a map of everyone else who has actively checked in. It gives you a new sense for all the activity happening right around you.
Kismet is launching a little late for the buzz building around SXSW this year, but it has a strong team, an interesting product, and some room to experiment. After an incubation period in AngelPad, the company (incorporated as Meh Labs) has raised $1 million in a seed round led by Triple Point Ventures, with participation from New Enterprise Associates and angel investors including Shiva Rajaraman, Steph Hannon and Roham Gharegozlou.
The app is currently only for iPhone, but look for it to expand to the other platform at some point."	2012-03-08	514312	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/meetings_profile.png?w=400	startups/	Kismet Combines Check-Ins, Background Location And More — A SXSW Dark Horse?		https://techcrunch.com/2012/03/08/kismet-combines-check-ins-background-location-and-more-a-sxsw-dark-horse/	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
3272	Romain Dillet	Apps	"Chances are you recently went back from a wedding, a road trip or any other meaningful social event, and all your friends took a bunch of photos with their phones. And yet, you won’t ever see these photos again, as they will stay in your friend’s camera roll forever. Crossroad is a new app for iOS and Android that lets you create collaborative albums in a few taps. It’s seamless, well-designed and useful in many occasions.
“During my stag party, we took a lot of photos. But we didn’t receive all of them after the weekend was over,” co-founder and CEO Mathieu Spiry told me. “At the time, we didn’t find any well-established competitors. So we thought we should try to do something — something extremely easy, that everybody could use, that would be practical. And of course it makes sense because everybody takes pictures with their phones today.”
Here’s how it works. Whenever you want to create a collaborative album with your friends, you can invite them with an email or text message. Once they have installed the app, the album will automatically show up on the main screen. Adding photos is just a matter of hitting the big plus button at the bottom of the screen to access your camera roll. And that’s it.
You can quit the app, it will continue uploading your pictures in the background, or you can browse your friends’ photos in the meantime. This album isn’t shared on Facebook or any public place, it’s just something between your friends and you. You can comment, like and read your friends’ comments.
If you want to make this album public, you can get a web gallery that you can share with people who weren’t at your event. You can also save an entire album to your camera roll.
There are two key reasons why Crossroad is intrinsically viral. First, the entire point of the app is to invite your friends to use it. The more people know about it, the more they are likely to create albums on their own.
Second, it’s unlikely that all of your friends will upload photos at the same time. For a wedding, you could open the app every day for a couple of weeks and get new photos from your friends. Swiping on a notification to see these new photos is a powerful way to make you come back to Crossroad.
There are many alternatives to Crossroad, including iCloud collaborative albums, a Dropbox folder, Whatsapp groups, Facebook Moments and more. Cluster is one of Crossroad’s most direct competitors, but the model is a bit different with this app. You create groups to get a private feed of your everyday pictures. With Crossroad, it’s all about reliving past events.
I first met the Crossroad team at a pitch event in Paris. The app had yet to be released but was already very polished for a beta version. Photos sync smoothly, the app supports big albums and everything simply makes sense. Crossroad doesn’t try to do everything, but it does a few things really well.

3297	Natasha Lomas	Apps	"Anyone who’s worked for any length of time in the publishing industry will, given the slightest amount of alcohol, wax lyrical about broken business models and the clickbaity-hell being wreaked on editorial content.
So it’s no surprise how often you find publishing industry types turning entrepreneurial in the hopes of building a better model for journalism and editorial content. E.g. Blendle and Blockfeed, to name two recent startups that spring to mind. (A third, Clippet, was co-founded by media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s grandson.)
London based Readbug is another startup with publishing industry expertise firing its engines. Co-founder and CEO Matthew Hammett has a background launching small and big magazine titles. And his startup pitch can be summed up very concisely — as ‘Spotify for magazines’.
Specifically independent, cult and classic magazine titles — so not the garish mass market fare you’ll find rammed in your eyeline at the supermarket checkout screaming about celebrities and cellulite. Readbug bills its aggregated digitized magazine content as alternative/aspirational stuff, read by “creative and curious” types. And Hammett says it’s deliberately “handpicking and curating” the titles it wants to repackage and distribute on its platform in order to establish its own editorial voice — as well it must to stand a chance of pulling eyeballs in an era of free info overload.
The app offers an all-you-can-eat content model across its selected magazine titles for a monthly subscription fee (currently costing £9.99 in the U.K.). Users can browse and read specific titles, as well as telling the app general interests to get relevant content pushed to them. There’s no freemium element as yet (aside from an initial seven day free trial)  but the plan is to add some free channels in future, showcasing a selection of content curated by Readmag staff, as a way to expand the app’s appeal down the line. 
Reader revenue is divided between Readbug and its publishing partners, with a 30:70 share. The publishers’ pot of money is divided between all the title owners, based on the content Readbug’s users have been reading each month. So it’s a pretty simple model — albeit an all-you-can-eat Spotify one, vs (for instance) rival journalism marketplace Blendle’s pay-per-article iTunes style offering.
Readbug’s pitch to its target indie publishers is the chance to increase their digital reach without having to do any extra work or spend any extra money themselves. They might even get to grow their dead-tree subscribers, given the team intends to add a buy button to the platform to make it easier for new media readers to become old media consumers too.
“My background’s publishing. I’ve come from some big publishing houses and it was as simple as just thinking there’s got to be a better model, and ‘Spotify for magazines’. There’s got to be a better distribution model for digital content, for a digital magazine,” Hammett tells TechCrunch, explaining the germ of Readbug’s idea. “And it’s really grown from there.”
“Part of the conversation [with publishers] is look, we’re not trying to replace print, we’re trying to open it up to a digital market,” he adds. “We convert all our content so it’s mobile friendly… We’re adding a buy-it-now function so the reader can — at the end of an article or a magazine — decide to purchase the magazine there and then.
“So from the publishers’ perspective it’s great… if they want to expand their print distribution to say South America there’s huge cost involved, but we can always market and dip test those areas for them.”
The team started off with a basic business pitch on equity crowdfunding site Seedrs, back in May last year, where they managed to raise £75,000 in around four days — more than the initial £50,000 they had been hoping for. They followed that up with another Seedrs round, pulling in £200,000 last November to get an initial product to market — going on to launch a beta version of their iOS app this February, with nine publishers on board.
They’re now crowdfunding to raise £500,000, again via Seedrs — taking in a small investment from London digital app studio ustwo as part of this round. This third tranche of financing will be focused on ramping up marketing to get more users, as well as continuing building out the number of publishers signed up, says Hammett.
The app currently offers 50 titles — including the likes of Dazed, Huck and Makeshift — with a further 10 ready to be added shortly. He says they’re aiming to have expanded to 125 titles by this time next year.
In terms of users, at this nascent stage, they’ve had around 9,000 downloads so far, and 3,000 registered users — again without doing any significant marketing. Who are the early users? They’re what Hammett describes as “trendsetters or tastemakers”. “They’re East London hipsters. Definitely people who work in creative sectors or ideas based industries,” he says.
On the publishing side, it’s been a tale of two very different mindsets: big vs small. Early discussions with big publishers about aggregating their content on the platform stalled owing to the terms being demanded, says Hammett — pushing Readbug to pivot to focus on the smaller indie mag segment.
“We had a lot of conversations and deals ready to go with some of the bigger publishing houses and the thing is with those guys they’re the big hulking beasts who are very difficult to move and innovate. So they were asking for huge minimum revenue guarantees and all these sort of things. In the end we were like ‘look guys, how much we’ve raised is in the public domain. We’re a small startup, a few people with big ideas — we can’t really lock into these sort of guarantees’,” he says.
“Something that really sprung out for us was that at the same time, we had about nine or so publishers who were kind of like independent publishers — so independent magazines — and these guys were completely different. It was a completely different conversation. They were like ‘yeah let’s push it globally, let’s do everything we can to get behind you, we’re really excited about it’. And so at the same time as shelving these more mainstream deals we really saw a group of publishers who were really behind us.”
Readbug digitizes the content it get from its publishing partners so they don’t have to — again, making the model a good fit for smaller indies who likely don’t have the resources to dabble around with tech themselves (vs big publishers who may well already have their own apps).
“Everything we do is to support the publishers so when we convert it to a digital format we use the publishers’ fonts, we use their color schemes, and try and inject some of that character back in to it as well,” says Hammett . “The analogy is the vinyl collector at home with his record collection but when he sets out the door sticks Spotify or sticks their playlist on… There’s a balance between the two.
“Ultimately it’s about broadening their reach. For a magazine to print 20,000 issues — that’s the limit of their reach, whereas for us we can take your labor of love, this beautifully crafted journalism, and we can push it out to a global, digital audience. There is a real appeal to them there.”
As well as faithfully reproducing entire indie magazines, cover to cover, in a mobile-friendly digital format, including any ads that were in the original magazines (albeit only as a scanned image, not a digital ad unit at this stage), the team also augments the content with any additional digital material a magazine might have produced for its own website, say. By, for example, embedding related video or audio content into relevant articles.
In future, Hammett says they want to work more closely with publishers on further enhancing the digital versions of their magazines that are being distributed on its platform. “We’re looking at things like in-house content… original content. Where we add in video content from publishers currently, to sort of say to these guys look, if you’re got photo shoots let us chip in on it as well and perhaps make it a video as well — stuff like that. Really try and support and enhance what publishers are doing.”
Interestingly, Hammett notes that the vast majority of current Readbug users (circa 95 per cent) are reading the digital magazine content on their phones, not their iPads (although the app is available for both device types). So the use-case is presumably more about filling in dead time during coffee breaks and commutes, rather than getting people to curl up in bed or on the sofa with their iPad for a long reading session — as you might expect them to do with an actual, paper magazine.
“It’s the device you’ve got closest to hand — your phone, basically — is what we’re interested in,” he notes, adding: “Readbug is available on iPad but it’s definitely not as interesting to us.”
The £9.99 per month fee seems a little steep for a magazine-based digital media offering which requires users apply their full attention in order to consume the content (vs music which can just be background noise) — especially when you consider moves by mobile device makers to freely repackage editorial content as another perk they push out, such as Apple News on iOS, or Samsung’s editorial alliance with Axel Springer.
That said, indie mag content does not come cheap — with Hammett noting that its target magazine titles are typically priced between £5 and £15 on the shelf. So the price-point is probably appropriately expensive enough for the style conscious buyers Readbug is targeting. He says the team hopes to have some 45,000 subscribers signed up by this time next year — quantifying how many hipsters he reckons will shell out for on tap mobile access to their reading matter of choice."	2015-11-21	1240756	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/readbug.png?w=738	europe/	Readbug Wants To Be Spotify For Indie Magazines		https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/21/readbug-wants-to-be-spotify-for-indie-magazines/	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	0	4
3457	Mike Butcher	Europe	"As Yo has proved, the public’s appetite for messaging seems not to have stopped with WhatsApp. Many others have appeared before an since. As Sarah Perez recently found out. Now another has appeared which plans to plug at our emotional side a little more, drawing the medium most tied to the heart: music.
Instead of a Yo, or a word or an image, new music messaging app La-La lets its users chat with audio snippets of songs.
Say you want to send a quick ‘hi’ to a girlfriend or boyfriend. On La-La you might select ‘Hello’ by Lionel Richie (I’m sure better songs are available), pick your friend’s contact and hit send. They can reply with their own sing choices, presumably until you’ve run out of ideas.
Users can also send La-La messages via SMS (for recipients without the app) or to someone befriended to their La-La account. The recipient doesn’t know what song snippet they got until they play it, adding that frisson on anticipation.
It reminds me of a different kind of take on music sharing, ThisIsMyJam, but done as messages.
Currently, La-La has a neat selection of licensed music by popular artists and has the option for users to create their own messages by searching YouTube for music and clipping out a section for sending.
Unlike other “music sending” apps out there that send song links attached to written chat messages users can’t chat with words in any way on La-La — only music.
This is probably good for teens but likely to be of some frustration to adults perhaps."	2014-07-16	1030286	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/screen568x568-28.jpeg?w=320	europe/	Music Messaging App La-La Lets Users Chat With Songs Snippets		https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/16/music-messaging-app-la-la-lets-users-chat-with-songs-snippets/	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
3461	Jordan Crook	Apps	"As we head into the depths of August (the month where time stands still), there is one interesting thing that starts to happen. Kids head back to school.
That said, we decided to use some new data from CampusBooks to look at how college students are approaching their schoolwork. Perhaps the most interesting finding was that 91 percent of college students prefer to take notes by hand.
Almost all of them have laptops, and 90 percent own smartphones. They spend more than a full day each week using these devices, with an average of almost eight hours on Facebook each week, five hours on YouTube, and three hours per week on Instagram and Twitter respectively. And still, these digital beasts prefer to take notes by hand.
And with good reason! Studies show that we retain information much better when we write it down by hand.
And so, we’ve compiled a few products that will help students take notes in whatever way is best for them.

LiveScribe offers two different SmartPens, a basic and a premium option, that will automatically transfer your notes over to your iPad as you write them down on paper. There’s no special journal necessary. Once you pair it with the free LiveScribe app, you can also record audio notes on your iDevice. This one is iOS only, but worth the investment for someone that takes detailed, lengthy notes and needs help staying organized.

Without a doubt, Evernote is one of the best digital note-taking products in the world. Not only does it let you sync typed notes and images across all your devices, but it will let you draw or write within each note. It’s one of the only apps that will let you type, draw, write, and snap a picture within the same note without any friction. The automatic organization of the app is based on date and location, but it isn’t as “smart” with organization as some other services.

Clear isn’t actually meant to be a note-taking app in the traditional sense. It’s more of a to-do list. Still, I use it to organize things like my groceries, my Amazon shopping list, and my daily list of chores and tasks, but beyond that, it’s pretty awesome for taking notes during interviews over the phone. Yes, it’s short and staccato one-liners, so if that’s your note-taking style, it may work well. However, if you’re long-winded with your notes, this may not be the app for you. Clear is cross-platform, so everything syncs across your devices.
Let’s say you’re part of the minority — you hate taking notes and refuse to do so. Let me introduce Rev. Rev lets you record lectures from your phone for free with great audio, and if you like, pay for human transcription with a 48-hour turnaround. It’s highly accurate, but can get costly if you’re using it all the time. This is for the student who is literally willing to pay to have someone else take their notes, or for the student who needs a supplement on those days you just can’t bring yourself to whip out the old journal."	2014-08-01	1038474	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/notes.jpg?w=738	gadgets/	Four Note-Taking Apps For The Tech-Forward College Student		https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/01/four-note-taking-apps-for-the-tech-forward-college-student/	1	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
3470	Sarah Perez	Apps	"Online design platform Canva, which makes it easy for anyone to create professional graphics quickly – even if they don’t have a design background – is expanding its reach today with the launch of its first-ever iPhone application. Up until now, the company had offered a web application for around three years, and had been available on iPad for a year. With its iPhone launch, Canva’s audience could grow beyond the business and marketing professionals who typically use its service today, and become more popular with consumers.
First launched around mid-2013, Canva was dreamed up by CEO Melanie Perkins whose previous company involved a system for building the layouts used in school yearbooks. She realized then there was demand for simple tools that made design more accessible to the mainstream.
Canva today offers an online editor and a library of templates, graphics, fonts, photos and more some of which can be used for free, while others may be available for just a dollar, given their one-time use cases. The platform lets you design a range of graphics for things like slideshows, handouts, posters, cards, collages, invitations, as well as those graphics needed for social media posts, Facebook Pages and more.

Most importantly, the way the system itself works has made it so easy that anyone can figure out how to put the various pieces together and end up with a professional-looking product, without having to turn to more advanced software like Photoshop or InDesign, for example.
Currently, the platform is used by more than 10 million people, including 50,000 Canva for Work subscribers, which is the company’s premium plan aimed at businesses. These subscribers include several notable names, like Yelp, Lonely Planet, Hubspot and Upworthy, for example. The company to date has raised over $30 million, according to CrunchBase data.
Though Canva emerged as an online service used from the desktop, there has been a growing demand for mobile. Its iPad application has now been downloaded 2 million times, and over half (53%) of its mobile visits today are coming from Apple devices. Meanwhile, the company says that around 30 percent of its engagement with its users via email and more on social media is done on the iPhone.
Combined with the fact that an iPhone app has been users’ most-requested product, Canva knew that launching on iPhone would be a priority this year.

“We’ve seen incredible growth as an online app for desktop computers, but we’ve always realised that mobile devices are becoming the dominant way that people interact online,” explains Canva co-founder and head of product Cam Adams. “It’s important for us to be available on all devices that people use to create visual content, so releasing the iPhone app is a giant leap towards Canva fulfilling that cross-platform vision.”
He adds that being available on the iPhone will open up the platform to a different type of creation – one that’s “more immediate, contextual and social,” he says.
“This will be extremely valuable to the businesses and marketers that we target currently, but will also be a great attraction for the consumer market, who will be able to use Canva to create some really unique content,” Adams notes.

The bigger challenge with the iPhone app was in bringing the breadth of tools that Canva offers to the smaller screen, while still keeping the experience simple.
The mobile app offers over a million layouts, stock photos and illustrations, which can be edited with fonts, photo filters, graphics, stickers, shapes and more. Included are hundreds of layouts for things like greeting cards, invitations, social media posts, sales events and flyers, business presentations, Facebook covers, social media graphics, and more.
Finished items can then be published to Facebook Pinterest, Instagram, and Google+ or saved for emailing or texting.
While there are a number of apps today for doing basic image edits on the iPhone, Canva has a couple of standout features that put it more in the “pro” space. One is its live camera mode, which lets you take a photo and see the camera live in the background of your design. That makes it easy to snap a pic that fits perfectly in the design you’ve chosen.
The other is its support for multi-page designs, which means it can be used for larger projects on the go, like business presentations.
Overall, the end result is an app that makes sense both for Canva’s core user base of business professionals, but one that could find it spilling over to the consumer market as well.
Canva for iPhone is available for free on iTunes."	2016-07-20	1355316	https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/canva-ios.jpg?w=738	mobile/	Canva brings professional design to anyone with its new iPhone app		https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/20/canva-brings-professional-design-to-anyone-with-its-new-iphone-app/	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4
